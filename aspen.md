## Michael MacDonald of the Doobie Brothers, is if nothing else, the posterchild of the genre of "Yacht Rock".
To the extent that the term does not explain itself, it should be thought of the particular branch of classic rock that incorporates feel-good 80's synthesizers and demands to be blasted on a boat (of any sort) while drinking MM beer in the summer. Michael MacDonald, Kenny Loggins, Steely Dan, Hall & Oates.

One place where yacht rock thrives today (30 years after its hayday) is Aspen, Colorado: 24 hours/day in hostel lobbies, from the speakers at various mid-mountain lifts, and at a large percentage of apres happy hours. The target audience for this music I would have to describe as the late-late-boomers, folks who are late in their careers, have strong memories of the 80's, and at least some level of fondness for the Grateful Dead.

Popular film has done a thorough job of documenting the sorts of parties which launched Aspen to America's Premier Ski Destination, the sorts of parties described by American Psycho and Hot Tub Time Machine. A modern incarnation of these parties (now we listen to The Chainsmokers) is still available every winter weekend in Aspen. These events feature hip DJ's, hip people, and semi-public hottubs.
