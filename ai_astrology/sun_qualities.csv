32,Sun Sign Description,"Astrologers are fond of this eleventh sign of the zodiac, for Aquarius is the sign of the future, of the visionary, some say of astrology itself. Aquarians are unorthodox, original people — sort of wacky, witty madcaps who refuse to follow the crowd and go their own way. You like being different. You not only march to a different drummer, you make up new music as you go along. Intellectual independence is your most marked characteristic. In the sign of Aquarius, the combination of a fixed quality (representing persistence) and an air element (representing intellect and communication) under the influence of the planet of change, Uranus, creates a personality that is liberal, progressive, yet fixed in opinion. Your inflexibility shows up when others least expect it (in keeping with your penchant for unconventionality) . It may be in defense of an idea you have, a trip you've decided on, a habit of yours that you refuse to give up — whatever the cause, someone will suddenly come in conflict with your Aquarian obstinacy. You refuse to compromise or give an inch. You're a strange mix of an avant-garde thinker whose opinions are written in stone. You cheerfully ignore what others think and strike off on new paths, unbound by precedent, because there are so many more exciting things for you to discover that way. You think boredom is a communicable disease and take every opportunity to avoid it. Your character is a system of paradoxes. You enjoy being with people but are content to be alone. You like to travel but love relaxing at home. You are friendly and outgoing but also detached and reserved. You have both a scientific and an artistic turn of mind. In career you often are involved in two distinct areas of work. Your astrological symbol is the Water Bearer — often Aquarius is mistaken for a water sign. Aquarius is an air sign. You are a communicator, an idea person. People born under this sign live most intensely in their minds. The ""water"" being poured out by the Water Bearer stands for truth. You are a truth-teller; you give out opinions and observations. You dispense wisdom. You are a seeker of knowledge, rational, open-minded, gifted with breadth of vision. Chock full of information, you still search for more. You always want to know what lies on the other side of the mountain. One Aquarian recently declared, ""It annoys me to find out there's something out there I've never heard of. I need to know what it is!"" You can be objective in judgment, for you don't let emotion get in the way. This appears to give you the ability to stand outside yourself, to rise above ordinary human frailty. Your built-in distrust of emotion compels you to struggle against its chains, and this may become a source of inner conflict. Problems arise when your sense of identity becomes inextricably linked to your ideas. Like Gemini, another air sign, you have a lot of ego invested in your opinions. When others disagree, you take this as an attack on your personhood. Your fixity turns into willfulness and rebelliousness for the sake of being a rebel. You deliberately refuse to recognize that your idea isn't working in the real world of your relationships or career — and you sabotage yourself by insisting on your way even if your way proves to be unfeasible. You are very people-oriented, addicted to the study of human beings and an inveterate people-watcher. Outgoing and amiable, you attract friends wherever you go. You have a talent for making people laugh with a pithy phrase that sums up a situation — though those who tangle with you quickly discover how your sharp verbal skills can deflate pomposity and pretension. You possess a true common touch, yet never lose your own strong individuality. Whomever you meet, you remain you — that amusing, inquisitive, interested person who wants to know what makes others tick. Your gift is for dealing with all kinds of personalities from every walk of life, no matter what their station or status. You never put on airs, nor are you cowed by anyone's wealth or position. If you met the Queen of England, you would be your natural self. We're all related, you believe, because we're all human beings. You are genuinely interested in why a person thinks this way or that. The nicest part is that you do not judge. You willingly grant to others what you consider an inalienable right: the freedom to be unique. For you, the ultimate liberation is simply the freedom to be oneself. As a student of human behavior, you have great tolerance for the weaknesses and foibles to which all mankind is heir. You are a humanitarian, concerned with the welfare of the world, but do not get deeply involved in intimate relationships. There is always a certain distant quality to you, a detachment or aloofness of spirit. You seem to disassociate yourself from emotion. However, the cool, arm's-length impression you give can be deceiving. In the zodiac Aquarius symbolizes friendship, and you can form close and enduring ties. Beneath your detached, seemingly unemotional exterior beats a stubbornly loyal heart. No one is a truer, finer friend than Aquarius. Completely free of malice, you'll do anything to be helpful. Yet you'll never let the other person become dependent on you. Your affection comes with no strings attached. Because independence is your way of life, you will sacrifice even a close personal relationship in order to maintain it. Trying to fence you in or tie you down won't work. If you feel trapped, you try to break free at any cost. Your sign of Aquarius also represents future hopes and yearnings, and for you, what's over is done with. You want to escape the past and, like Peter Pan, head straight on to morning. You're wonderful at hatching schemes and dreams, plotting trips, setting goals. The unusual — in people, places, and projects — is what really interests you. As an idealist you would like to see that everybody is happy, and your ambition is to do something important and meaningful. Many Aquarians go into politics or become involved in social causes. This is the astrological sign of hopes and wishes, and you are the kind who follows a dream. History is dotted with progressive Aquarian thinkers such as Charles Darwin, Abraham Lincoln, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. An Aquarian will hatch up a grandiose scheme for improving the way things are, but your main interest is in creating the idea, not translating it into action through work. Hard work doesn't interest you. You are creative, imaginative, endlessly willing to experiment, but the drudgery of detail and the minutiae of management are not your style. You'd rather invent a new Utopian scheme and let others grapple with the hard realities. Your great weakness is a tendency to inflate your own importance, to pose as an expert on any subject. You are so determined not to be like anyone else that you are sometimes contrary just to be different. You have the least regard for convention of any zodiacal sign, which often gives you a reputation for being eccentric. Just as you are broad-minded about the faults of others, you take for granted that your shortcomings will be overlooked. Sometimes you will be argumentative not because you feel deeply, but simply because you enjoy the intellectual exercise. You are quickly bored and take delight in verbally provoking anyone you consider stodgy and dull. Nevertheless, Aquarians are among the kindest people in the world. Easygoing, reasonable, slow to take offense, never mean-hearted, you believe in live-and-let-live. Honest, helpful, altruistic, and best of all never boring, you can change anyone's life for the better just by becoming part of it. "," Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, the sign that symbolizes new beginnings. It connotes quick changes and sudden forks in the road. Your life is marked by arriving at a certain place and then being turned in a new direction. Certainly, one can say your life is adventurous! There is a dynamic restlessness to the Aries character. With the Sun in this sign, you are an activist and doer. If you have a new plan or idea — if an enterprise strikes your fancy — you can't wait to plunge right in. The amusing little prayer, ""Grant me patience NOW!"" is typical of the Arien attitude. When others first meet you their instant impression is of someone exciting, vibrant, talkative. Others will be lucky if they can get a word in edgewise. If someone brings up a topic, you will be delighted to tell in great detail exactly what you think about it. As an Aries person you gravitate toward the center of action. You are audacious and intent on getting your own way. Since your nature is to express power, you treat opposition as an annoyance to be brushed out of the way. You are a natural leader who exudes self-confidence. From an early age you feel you are headed for success. Happily, you are also generous about helping others in a crisis. You are an openhearted friend who shares ideas and advice, and likes to pick up the check. You have a quality of largesse. You are not interested in the small or petty. ""Go for the best"" is your motto. There is nothing faint or half-hearted about an Arien. Whereas others may be more cautious, you actually enjoy living on the edge. A touch of recklessness makes you feel alive. The chase is always more thrilling than getting the goal. (As one Aries recently remarked rather insightfully, ""Wanting is always better than getting."") You are willing to take a gamble, follow a dream, set your mind on a goal, and pursue it with irresistible enthusiasm. Your supreme quality of optimism attracts others. Underneath there may lurk insecurity, but no one will ever know about it. This is not to say you don't get depressed or moody. But the winter of despair doesn't last a week with Aries. You have an uncrackable optimism. It is true, however, that Aries people are notorious for taking offense at fancied slights and injuries. Hot tempers and childish tantrums abound, and your threshold of boredom is extremely low. If success is not immediate, you tend to lose interest and go in search of other excitement. As a result, patient, plodding types often get to the head of the class before you do. Ariens have a well-deserved reputation for not finishing what they have begun. You are very short of patience, and your lack of stick-to-itiveness is your weak spot. Also, you spend your energy in too many different ways, like the Ring Lardner hero who mounted a horse and rode off in all directions at once. Independence is a keyword. You can turn sulky and peevish if you have to take orders. You would much rather be the world's largest lizard than the world's smallest dragon. You want to run the whole show. If you can't, you pull up stakes and look for a situation in which you can show off your style and brilliance. Should you come up against a superior force, you will bend but never break. Your aggressive and combative spirit cannot be broken by anyone — except yourself. One of the pitfalls of being an Aries is that you're essentially self-involved. Unless you make an effort to look outward at others and their feelings, you can easily become a spoiled brat. Though generally sincere and honest, you will tell a white lie if it seems advantageous. You are not a very adept liar, however; others see right through you. Sometimes you lack tact and diplomacy, but no malice is intended. Sagittarians also lack this quality of tact because they don't know how to be oblique or roundabout. With you, tactlessness is an impulsive act — a careless expression of your innate force. Too often you speak without thinking and say whatever pops into your mouth, and usually regret your impulsiveness later. Aries is lucky with money, but has trouble holding on to it. You tend to run up big bills, live extravagantly, soar over budget. However, you usually find a way to pay off what you owe. You have too much pride to remain in anyone's debt. In friendship you give magnanimously if someone is in need, but you want to get credit for your good deeds. In the garden of Aries, there are few shrinking violets. You are creative, openhearted, high-spirited, pioneering, also vain, feisty, and impatient. Those who deal with you on an intimate basis will have one chief problem: How are they going to keep up the pace?","No one has ever said Cancerians are easy to understand. You may appear gentle, kind, sympathetic, and a patient listener. Then someone asks for advice, and you turn cranky, snappish, and appear to be completely indifferent to anyone's problems but your own. You may wallow in self-pity and complain endlessly about how mistreated you are by the world. Turn another page of the calendar and suddenly you are back being helpful, solicitous, ready to do anything asked of you. More than any other sign, Cancer is a series of contradictions. You prize security above all else, yet love new adventure. You are the soul of caution but you're also a courageous initiator who goes out of your way to push over obstacles with your driving personality. What's your secret? Cancer, which is ruled by the Moon and has water as its element, can be likened to the shifting tides of the oceans. Like the tides, Cancer is the sign of powerful forces moving under the surface. That surface, however, is quite difficult to penetrate, for Cancerians tend to build up an elaborate array of defenses to hide their deep feelings and extreme sensitivity. Complex, fragile, unpredictable, temperamental, the typical Cancerian needs constant support and encouragement. You want desperately to be loved and approved of but resent needing approval so badly. Cancer's big lesson is to recognize the hidden anger you carry within you and not allow this to corrode the relationships that give you the emotional support you seek. Happily, when you get what you need, you give the best you have in return. Those who make you feel secure command your undying loyalty. When you really care for someone there is nothing anyone can say about that person that will make the least bit of difference. You have a real blind spot when it comes to seeing a failing in those you love. If you could wave a magic wand and do the one thing that would make you happier it is to crack open that Crab shell and venture out into the world of possibility. Staying enclosed emotionally and psychically keeps you fearful. Cancer's fears are based on the fact that you have a difficult time trusting. You don't trust others or the universe or yourself. One Cancer told me recently, ""We've been sold a bill of goods by the stories we were told as children. There is no joy or happiness in life. Life is just plain hard."" The problem with this point of view is it leaves very little opening for any kind of abundance to flow in. It's hard to see the kindness in loved ones or the generosity of strangers or unexpected luck in an arduous situation if one has decided from the start that it's a dog-eat-dog world. Yet most contradictory of all is the fact you're such a nurturer who gives unselfishly to anyone who needs you. Your greatest impact is in human relationships; you have an instinct for making others feel cared for and understood. Among your most endearing traits is your loyalty. You tend to be a worrier and a silent brooder. People may pour out their hearts to you, but the flow never goes in the other direction. You are cautious about revealing too much of yourself; you guard your secrets well. If offended, you do not strike back directly. Your method of retaliation is to sulk, and it is often very effective. The technique is somewhat like being whipped to death by a dozen strands of boiled spaghetti. Cancer's symbol, the Crab, has a hard outer shell that protects soft, vulnerable flesh underneath. The same is true of Cancerians, who are often crusty, gruff, and grumpy, but possess a proverbial heart of gold. Beneath your tough exterior you are a sentimental softie who will make any sacrifice for someone in need. If someone asks for a favor, your first reaction will probably be no, but the final answer is always yes. You should be judged not by what you say but by what you do. You are possessive. Anyone who becomes part of your life will never again be entirely free. You try to stay in touch with friends, ex-lovers, former spouses, business associates, persons you knew as children. Cancer is the cosmic collector — if you let anyone go out of your life, it is unwillingly and never completely. This reflects your preoccupation with the past. An aura of nostalgia dwells about you; the events and people of bygone years continue to inhabit your memory and usually grow dearer to you as time goes by. You are devoted to family and home and continue to believe in the old-fashioned idea that marriage is forever — even if the events of your own life contradict this. It is hard to deceive you, for you can spot the tiniest nuances of behavior. In fact, you are almost psychic in your intuitions. A photographic memory added to intense powers of observation makes you extremely canny about divining other people's inner motivations. Cancerians are crablike in their indirect approach to an intended target. Observe a crab moving on a beach and you will notice its strange sidewise movement toward a goal. People born under the sign of the Crab never take the direct approach. You step to one side, then step to the other side, and sometimes go completely around. But you get where you intend to go. If channeled in the right direction, your enormous sensitivity can be a great source of strength. Once you overcome your shyness and touchiness and master your turbulent emotions, your intellect and imagination enable you to become a success in almost anything you undertake. You have the ability to dig into your own inner life and turn creativity into practical ideas. Contrary to the impression you often give, you can be shrewd and canny in business. Cautious, conservative in your approach, you possess an antenna that quickly gauges public taste and opinion and senses new trends in the making. You're also an on-the-mark judge of people. You are artistic and creative, and have formidable intellectual talents. This instinct for business combined with imagination is magical for acquiring financial security, and Cancer is called a ""money sign"" because of its ability to attract wealth. Cancer people hold on to money as tenaciously as they do to everything that belongs to them. To you money spells security, yet no matter how much wealth you accumulate you never feel really secure. That is true of your emotional security also. A Cancerian never gets enough love and approval; you always need more. It is very easy to fall in love with this loyal, devoted, affectionate, and protective Moon-child. ","Capricorns are ambitious, and the lives of those born under this sign are marked by a purposeful pursuit of their destiny. Your motivating force is desire for success, money, status, position, authority, and (though you may not realize it) for love. Capricorn is both an earth sign and a cardinal sign, and the combination of practicality (earth) and initiative (cardinal) produces a personality geared toward leadership and power. In the zodiac Capricorn is linked to the Midheaven — the point at the top of the horoscope that represents high achievement. You're a born climber who's not content to poke along down in the valleys. As long as there is a top to get to from the bottom, you will persevere in your upward striving. Your symbol is the Goat, and everyone knows how goats bound up impassable terrain, finding footholds where no one thought they existed. You always carry with you the knowledge that there are tasks to be fulfilled and if you can't move mountains, then at least, like the Goat, you can scale the heights. Your ruler Saturn is the planet of limitations, which includes the limitation of time. (To the ancients, Saturn was the symbol for Father Time.) You have a heightened sense of the value of time, which helps to make you a superb organizer and planner. Unlike those who don't look beyond next month, you will carefully examine your goal, separate it into all its necessary steps, and plot out a long-term timetable that often involves years. In the sign of Capricorn the quality of patience reaches new heights. One of the hallmarks of your sign is that you learn to wait for things you want. You are willing to give up today's temptation for tomorrow's reward. An aura of melancholy and sternness often surrounds you. Saturn has been called the Celestial Taskmaster, for it symbolizes responsibility, discipline, and restriction. As a child of Saturn, you need something to improve and to perfect. You could have been the prototype for Lewis Carroll's sly and charming jingle about industriousness: ""How doth the little crocodile improve its shining tail. . . ?"" You are ambitious, practical, and, above all, determined. You are not interested in vague theory; you want to put any knowledge to use. Your active mind quickly grasps ideas, and you have an admirable ability to concentrate. You are precise and orderly, and generally don't trust others to look after details. When you give your word you stick to it, and when you undertake a task you complete it to the best of your ability. You tend to fuss over details and to make sure all contingencies are covered. It's your way of being in control. Because of your diligence, people sometimes fail to give you credit for creativity. Yet you are highly creative — your skill is to link this to your talent for organization. You put dreams into action, and are especially drawn to the artistic arena and the performing arts. You think of yourself as a real person in a real world that allows little time for idle pleasure-seeking. In certain ways, Saturn is an austere and strict parent that lives inside each Capricorn. Essentially, you feel you can depend only on yourself. The child in you feels unworthy — and your lifelong lesson is to shed this feeling and learn to love yourself. You do not need to be your own parent who disciplines and keeps you toeing the line. You yourself must allow the spontaneous part of you to play and run. Your remoteness of spirit is often misunderstood by others; it has been described as cold passion. But you are not cold as much as self-sufficient. Because you need to organize and control your surroundings, on occasion you take a strong hand in other people's lives. To you, it's not meddling but handling things better. Beneath your reserve there is a sensitive and sympathetic person, and anyone who needs a strong shoulder to lean on needn't look further than Capricorn. Certainly you do not deserve your reputation for being sober and gloomy. One of your more striking characteristics is a sense of humor. Your wit may be dry, incisive, but it is extremely funny and has a way of erupting when others least expect it. As is your nature with everything else in life, you are cautious and conservative with money. Chances are you will amass wealth during your lifetime (usually in the later years), for you know how to make sound investments. In business your success is due to painstaking preparation. The journey of ten thousand miles may begin with a single step, but you know you can't get anywhere unless you first know where you're going. You may not size up a situation as quickly as some, but this can be an advantage, for it means you won't heedlessly plunge in. Instead, you will research, examine what others have done before, and gather all relevant data. Only then, with a thorough understanding of the details, will you begin to move. And then you won't be stopped until you reach your goal. You are not comfortable with ambiguity. You seek certainty and tend to see things in black and white. Emotional gray areas are troublesome, and you turn away from them. To the unevolved Capricorn there is only one ""right"" way, which is his or her way. Capricorn can be closed-minded and critical, and put value only in power and success. Your basic concern is for security. That goal comes first and you are usually materialistic. You can be spiteful toward those who stand in the way. You have a great sense of pride and will not forgive anyone who belittles or slights you. By the same token you will repay favors done for you. Scorpios also go out of their way to repay a kindness, but in their case it is done out of a sense of gratitude and fidelity. With you the motivation is pride that does not allow you to live comfortably under an obligation. More than any other sign of the zodiac, Capricorns marry for money and prestige. In most relationships you must dominate, because when you are in control you do not feel vulnerable to another person's power. In small ways you are continually testing the loyalty of those close to you. You are the loner of the zodiac, but have a great need to be loved and appreciated. Unfortunately, you won't let this need be known — in fact, you are a past master at concealing it. Underneath the mask, you wear still other masks, and it can take a long time to discover the real you. To others you may appear aloof, indifferent, hard to reach because you are so self-contained. But the very elusiveness of your Capricorn personality can be hypnotically attractive. Like a riddle wrapped inside a sphinx, there seems to be a fascinating secret buried in your depths. Anyone who cares enough to penetrate your shell of reserve will be greatly rewarded. Your affections and loyalty run deep, and you cherish and protect those you love. And you stick around when the going is toughest.","People born under this sign are many-sided, quick in thought and action, clever with words, skillful at handling others, brimful of new ideas. Astrologers regard this third sign of the zodiac as the quintessentially human sign, for it seems to sum up qualities that are the distinguishing hallmarks of the human race — intelligence (Gemini is an air sign), adaptability (Gemini is a mutable sign), and communicativeness (Gemini is ruled by Mercury). Gemini people do not sit back and watch the scenery go by. As a Gemini, you are endlessly curious about everything and must be part of the busy passing scene. If all the world's a stage, Gemini must be the actor on that stage. Unlike Leo, who wants only to be the star, Gemini wants to play all the parts — and be the director, the producer, and the stagehand! Duality is your most famous trait. You usually want more than one of everything. That includes jobs, hobbies, careers, and lovers. Basically your nature is restless, on the go, in quest of new ideas and fresh experiences. Things get very dull for you unless you have a constant change of scenery. Variety is your game. As a result, you often leave a trail of unfinished tasks. Your tendency is to fritter away energy on too many projects instead of concentrating your cleverness on one task. Gemini is the sign of communication, and its natives have an urgent and continual need to communicate. You enjoy writing notes, chatting with strangers, surfing the web, tossing off e-mails, IM's, and text messages — and the telephone is a major means of communication. People should learn not to give you their number if they don't like to spend a lot of time on the phone! Your astrological symbol should really be the question mark. You're a perpetual student of life who never stops asking questions. You love to talk to people, and this is the great secret of your charm. Others open to you like flowers. As a result, you're a marvelous people-manager who can rev up enthusiasm and loyalty. Born with the gift of persuasion, you could sell ice in Greenland. Your quick mind can explain any action, defend any position, justify any course. A mental magpie, you pick up information here, gossip there, tidbits everywhere. This makes you an ideal conversationalist, for you know a little about everything, though, some have said, not a lot about anything. You also are inclined to have firm opinions on everything (subject to revision at a moment's notice). What you value most is intellectual independence, and what you lack most is perseverance. Another Gemini weakness is superficiality. Because you are so quick to grasp an idea or size up a situation, you tend to skim its surface, not bothering to explore it in any depth. The other side of the coin, however, is that with very little preparation you can make a marvelous initial impression. Your facile gifts of writing, speaking, and self-expression make you a success in dealing with the public. You have a quicksilver personality that can adapt to many kinds of people. You are often drawn to the stage and the dramatic arts. Among famous writers and performers born with the Sun in Gemini are Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Dashiell Hammett, Lillian Hellman, Laurence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe, and Judy Garland. Amusing, versatile and witty, you are a wonderful friend who lifts people out of their doldrums. Does someone need advice? Instruction? An introduction? You're right there, ready to jump in, and others are energized by your enthusiasm. It's easy to see why you are usually surrounded by friends and admirers because you're such fun to be with. True, you can be impatient with persons who aren't as quick as you are, or who can't keep up with the rapid flow of your thought and speech. However, your natural exuberance sweeps even the most reluctant and surly along with you. In almost any situation you can be as charming as you want to be — with a little extra thrown in. Life is a jest and all things show it; I thought so once and now I know it, spells out the philosophy of Gemini. You don't waste time plumbing dark emotional depths, and you certainly don't want to get sucked into anyone's problems that might sabotage your freedom. Though you do have a brooding side to your Jekyll and Hyde disposition, you determinedly put on a cheerful face so you make the best impression. You try not to let anything dampen your high spirits or throw cold water on the fun and games. Geminis have a wide range of contacts and benefit from the advice and help of influential people. You will attract financial luck, but a tendency toward extravagance often more than offsets it. In your ledger, income always adds up to something a little short of outgo. Routine and monotony are two things you dread, and you will go to any lengths to avoid them. Change is your keyword, and what you value most is freedom. It's useless for anyone to try to pin you down. For you, the fun is in traveling, not in arriving at a destination. You love to explore new territory, see the way people live on the other side of the world. Inquisitive and imaginative, you are open to a different way of looking at things. Your trendy, up-to-date lifestyle has you constantly living off the fad of the land. For the sheer fascination of it, people should have at least one Gemini in their lives. (Two might be exhausting.) ","Your loyalty is beyond question. You are devoted to yourself. All Leos possess a kingdom. The kingdom may be big or small, it may be your home or a lover or a piece of creative work or your whole career. But whatever it is, you are unquestioningly ruler of this kingdom. Selfassurance surrounds Leo people like a ghost image on a television set. While others wait in the wings, you bask in the spotlight. Whatever you do, you do with a flair for the dramatic — everything about you is theatrical. You don't have to look for a role to play in life. You've found it. You are the monarch of all you survey. When you enter a room you secretly hope everyone will stand up and sing a few stanzas of the Hallelujah Chorus! At a party it isn't long before you assume control of the evening. Witty, vivacious, a fluent talker, you are a born entertainer who can lend spice to any occasion. Your energy is electric, and people gravitate to you as steel filings to a magnet. Your Sun sign confers a great flair for drama and an instinct for getting attention. Because your nature is flamboyant and expansive, you despise the humdrum, the ordinary, and the dull. When real life does not supply all the excitement you need, you try to create your own. Hyperbole is second nature to you. You are born to do things in a r-r-really big way. If you invite people to your castle (which is how you think of your home), you entertain them royally. You are a splendid host. Others may become reconciled to accepting second best; not Leos. Born under the most royal sign of the zodiac, there is absolutely nothing Leo people can think of that's too good for them. Luxury is as vital to you as breathing. You want to enjoy the good life, and never mind what it costs. You are not a good haggler or bargainer because basically you want what you want when you want it. Your public image is very important to you. When a Leo woman's checking account is down to two figures somehow she'll find the means to buy a glorious new dress, and when his credit cards are overdrawn a Leo man will still make reservations at the best restaurant in town. Leos are the most lavish spenders in the zodiac (Librans run a close second). Generous, kind, and openhearted, you find it hard to believe ill of others. If injured, you strike back quickly, but you also forgive easily and never hold a grudge. Marvelously affectionate and cheerful, you have genuine joie de vivre. The Sun is your ruler, and you always bring some sunshine into the lives of others. Obviously, this is one of your most endearing traits. In many ways you are like the Sun itself — life-enhancing, radiating energy and magnetism, burning with steady fixity. Astrologers call Leos eternal children, for you take pleasure from the moment and are uninhibited in giving affection. No one could ask for a better friend. If approached in the right way (flattery is the right way), you will do almost anything, but you expect praise and appreciation and admiration in return. Pride is your Achilles' heel. Your ego demands not respect but adoration, not compliments but flattery, and when you receive lavish praise you never stop to wonder if it is insincere. Despite your self-centeredness, you need others to give to if only to get back their appreciation. However, because you're too proud to ask for appreciation, you often suffer silently from a wounded ego. Your hidden secret is you need to be needed. In business you are the one in command. Another sign that gravitates toward authority is Capricorn, but its natives steadily climb toward a high position. Leos simply assume that they were born to high position. One of your most useful assets in career is an unerring instinct for getting along with people who are in a position to be helpful. You know the value of socializing and work best in group enterprises rather than solitary pursuits. You're an ordergiver, not an order-taker, but you're usually so cheery and enthusiastic others don't mind taking orders from you. You are also a hard worker who doesn't ask more of anyone else than you do of yourself. You won't quail before a challenge or flinch from a confrontation. You will do the thing that scares you because to do otherwise spells failure to your eyes. You are ambitious, but not ruthless. All you ask is to be in the limelight. Among your most striking characteristics is a refusal to be hampered by petty rules. Day-to-day routine quickly leads to boredom and makes you desperately unhappy. Your unhappiness doesn't last long, because you simply won't put up with it. You have an unshakable belief in your luck and quickly bounce back from despondency. It is difficult (though not impossible) to dislike a Leo. True, you can be bombastic and overbearing at times. True, you love to give advice and tell people how to run their lives. Like your symbol, the Lion, you can be quite indolent and lazy; you like to sit back and bask in your own glory. But your great warmth and sunny disposition is very hard to resist. The world would be much less fun without Leos. ","Librans are easy to like , for you have a captivating charm, possess elegant taste, and are usually beautiful to look at. In addition, you have the gift of making others feel important, for you are a superb listener and instinctively know how to draw out another person. You're famous for how effortlessly you smooth ruffled feathers, bring out smiles, and make others think they're the most wonderful people in the world. You're a born charmer. Ruled by Venus, goddess of love and beauty, you admire loveliness in all its forms, in music, art, decoration, and people. Your home will always have a touch of elegance, and you love to entertain in style. Flowers, champagne, lovely jewelry and clothes, beautiful (and expensive) objets, luxurious surroundings — these are the ornaments of life to you. You enjoy all the things that money can buy. A narcissist at heart, you expect admiration. You wish to be the jewel in the center of any setting, and you have a computer memory for any compliment ever paid to you. You tend to judge others by outward appearances. If someone has a charming facade, you won't look any deeper. As a result you may become easy prey for a sophisticated schemer with an affable manner. Libra is the zodiacal sign of Partnerships — in psychological terms the sign is outer-directed. Your energies are focused on melding and combining with other people; you are at your best in personal relationships. Your real energy, however, goes into people. Whether they be partners, lovers, mates, family, friends, business associates, or even guests at your party — relationships are your metier. You're simply not a loner. Instinctively, you try to magnetize and pull others toward you. However, your main interest is on yourself within the relationship. You deal intuitively with other people's emotions, and no one is better at understanding and taking into consideration another person's point of view. Yet all too soon that outside viewpoint will be lost or subsumed within your own subtly self-centered concerns. In the professional world you're a superb team player. You're able to meld many disparate egos into one smoothworking union. Your friendships and associations bring opportunities, and your best luck comes when you pool your creative talents and intelligence with powerful individuals who open doors for you. Born under the sign of the Scales, you strive for balance and harmony and are happiest when your environment is ordered and serene. Peace is worth any price to you and usually you will go a long way out of your way to avoid friction and dissension. Because you see clearly every side of an argument, every possibility of a given course, you have the tact and ability to smooth over disputes. You are a born diplomat. In order to avoid an unpleasant scene, you will even stifle your own true feelings. In fact, far too often you are not sure what your true feelings are. Because you try to be all things to all people, there is a general impression that you are indecisive. You appear to be constantly poised on an edge, seemingly unable to move one way or another, balancing pro with con, advantage with disadvantage, risk with gain. Underneath your genial, calm surface, you have to struggle in order to make decisions. The problem is that at Libra's center is someone who does not feel complete in himself or herself. Beneath your brilliance and charm, you feel a psychic lack, something missing — whether this something is a perfect lover, a fulfilling career, a wonderful project that shows off your talents, etc. And so you spend a lot of time feeling you're not ""real,"" that you've conned others into thinking you're smart and successful, but very soon they'll find out you're a fraud. One of Libra's best-hidden secrets is how shaky your self-confidence is — and certainly your sense of not being whole and creating a false front is at the core of your insecurity. Although you have superb instincts, you don't trust them enough. You are likely to be an underachiever because of your easygoing attitude. For the most part, you don't want anything badly enough to fight for it. The exception is when you're denied a privilege to which you feel entitled. That ruffles your fur. Librans have a reputation for stubbornness, but that's because you are sticklers for fairness. You resent being treated unfairly and become upset at inequity in the world at large. In general, it seems your strength is only brought out by crisis. This is when you're at your most courageous. You get along harmoniously with people who are even-tempered, particularly those who can laugh in the face of difficulties. You are particularly appreciative of talent in any field, whether art, literature, or music, and if you lack talent yourself you often indulge in artistic hobbies. Often people are surprised at the wide range of your interests because you hide your superior intellect under an agreeable, easygoing exterior. Libra is a cardinal sign, which means you're an initiator. You love new projects, unusual people, different ideas, and you'll travel anywhere. Gifted with imagination, flair, and enthusiasm, you have an open, independent mind that tries to evaluate the world dispassionately and rationally. You also have a good head for money (though your great weakness is a love of luxury). Indeed, money has a way of slipping through your fingers because it isn't money you love, it is the things money can buy. Essentially frivolous, people born under this sign dislike hard work — unless someone else is doing it. A love for beauty leads many natives of this sign to careers in art, decorating, the theater, and composing, but the approach often remains that of a dilettante who enjoys the reward but avoids the effort needed to attain it. You are an incorrigible idealist and quintessential romantic. Affectionate, warmhearted, sentimental, naturally optimistic, you do everything in your power to please. Your stock-in-trade is charm. ","Just as the first sign of the zodiac, Aries, represents a new beginning so the twelfth and last sign, Pisces, is the end of the circle, the sign of eternity, reincarnation, and spiritual rebirth. Many astrologers say that Pisces is a link to the spirit world and that you who are born under this sign are old souls, for they believe Pisceans to have experienced other lives in the past. Pisceans have an otherworldly quality. In mystical terms, you are described as being half-body and half-spirit, pulled between material existence and spiritual concerns, possessed of the knowledge that you will never be entirely at home in the real world. Like natives of the other water signs (Cancer and Scorpio), you have the ability to see deeply into the human psyche. Subtle and intuitive, you are born with the gift of prophecy, and may even become involved in the occult, ESP, and spiritualism. Because you have a close relationship with astral forces, you feel things before you know them and your feelings are rarely wrong. If you get a hunch, others would be wise to pay attention. Part of your clairvoyance stems from the fact that you understand first with your heart, and only then do you rationalize what you know intuitively. Ruled by Neptune, planet of mystery and illusion, your personality is elusive, fey, and quicksilvery. Your element is water, and the imagery of the sea is evident in how easily you adapt to the ever-shifting currents around you. More than natives of any other sign, you are enormously influenced by your surroundings and by the people who touch your life. Indeed, you have a unique ability to get under another person's skin, to take literally as your own another's problems, joys, and woes. You have tender sympathy for anyone or anything that hurts; sick plants, hungry animals, and friends in need — they all find a home with you. At times you give away the very strength and emotional security you need for yourself. You possess superb intuitions and a seemingly bottomless understanding of other people, yet your extraordinary sensitivity can be your most vulnerable point. You are too impressionable to each passing influence, too susceptible to someone else's hard-luck story or plea for help. For you, learning to say no can be a lifetime project and you may never learn how to do it at all. Ancient astrologers called Pisces the sign of Sorrow from SelfUndoing, and you can easily become the creator of your own downfall. You are impractical and fall prey to overindulgence. You also have a penchant for picking the wrong companions. A fatal flaw in Pisces is the tendency to flee from what you don't want to deal with, and this can lead you into a world of addictive behavior. At times, your life may become so punctuated with trouble and heartache that you try desperately to escape, and then you are like Eliza jumping from ice floe to ice floe, with no clear sense of where you are headed. Your symbol, two fishes tied together swimming in opposite directions, represents conflicting emotions and desires that pull you to and fro. You must fight hard for stability, for the strength of purpose and balance needed to combat the negativity of laziness, carelessness, and emotional confusion. You need to develop a positive self-image, play on your strengths and ability to take responsibility, not let yourself fall victim to bad choices and your predilection for self-undoing. Your life lesson is to learn self-doing. Certainly, you do not lack backbone. Indeed, you are capable of great sacrifice and hard work in the service of a cause or an ideal. Intellectually you are curious and like to explore the unusual and hidden. Although you can be impractical, even lazy, you are also capable of prodigious work when you are involved in a project you truly care about. The thing is that despite the fact that you work unselfishly for others, you find it hard to be strict and disciplined with yourself. Not many natives of this sign are suited to the harsh, rough-and-tumble world of business and commerce. Pisces is the mystical sign of the poet and the dreamer, and you are more successful as a writer, musician, or artist. You're intensely imaginative and addicted to make-believe, and you strive to create a world that comes closer to your own unique vision. When you put your energy into creating fantasies, you're the most creative artist in the zodiac. Among famous Piscean creators are Pierre -Auguste Renoir, Frederic Chopin, Enrico Caruso, Vaslav Nijinsky, Rudolph Nureyev, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Edna St. Vincent Millay. Because you blend compassion and understanding with great verve, you exert a unique power on people whose lives touch yours. You may feel you lack self-confidence to be a leader, but you are definitely a guide, teacher, and role model to many. You are also a fey charmer and a mischievous wit who loves to laugh. Yet because you are fundamentally unsure of yourself, you prefer to work alone rather than with people. You have an instinct for finding what appears to be the easy way out, and founder in the shallows of least resistance. This is why so many talented, charming, superior natives of this sign never attain the position in life to which their gifts entitle them. You are a very special person whose sensitivity and awareness will always appeal to a select group. You are capable of high intellectual achievement and your magnetic, mysterious, engaging and delightful personality is heightened by an intriguing sense of drama. You are also loyal, unselfish, and generous, always ready to help a friend who has fallen on hard times. In fact, you often create a special kind of magic — when you concentrate on the best and reject what is ugly and meanspirited, people are likely to live up to your vision. You have a deep appreciation for the inner qualities of others; you are not concerned with the superficial and with what others see on the surface. You look at the inner soul, the essence. There is no more sensitive, perceptive friend, nor one more warmhearted, caring, devoted, and sentimental. ","Ruled by Jupiter, planet of fortune, you appear to breeze through life. You are Lady Luck's compan- ion who seems always to be in the right place at the right time. Astrologers say you have the gift of providence — luck protects you. In work, friendships, career, money — a door opens just when you need it. Naturally, this makes for a cheerful and ebullient disposition. You have your dark moments, but clouds roll over quickly. You are too interested in what is going to happen tomorrow to fret long about what went wrong today. You are always sure that around the next bend of the road something wonder- ful is about to happen. In Sagittarius, the enthusiasm of fire, the restless muta- ble quality, and the jovial influence of Jupiter combine to produce an expansive personality who cannot be confined. Independence is your guiding principle. You are progres- sive, restless in spirit, eager to get on with the business of living — a free, adventurous spirit who thrives on new ideas and constant change of scene. Somewhere you picked up a chronic case of wanderlust, and you have no desire to be cured. The grass is always greener someplace else, and your restless, inquiring nature requires travel, ex- citement, and the unconventional. Sagittarius, like its op- posite sign Gemini, wants to know. But whereas Geminis are happy to sample a new idea, Sagittarians will follow it as far as it will go. In the zodiac, Sagittarius symbolizes the search for wisdom; this is the sign of the philosopher and the explorer. Sagittarians are hard to pin down emotionally. You don't want to get bogged down in messy entanglements or anything that ties you down. You've got places to go and you're not about to sign up for anything that keeps you in one spot. The way to stay unfettered is to shy away from emotion. Sagittarians rarely talk about their feelings — they talk about what they think about their feelings. Time and again Sagittarians are bewildered when their romantic partners ask for more passion and feeling. Because you keep one eye on the exit door and don't welcome endur- ing, profound relationships, sooner or later, you'll unknot the tie that binds. Friendship, however, is a different matter. You are al- ways willing to be a pal — and you are the nicest friend in the zodiac. Kind, openhearted, jovial, completely free of malice, you are always doing favors for others. Your way of helping doesn't put the recipient under heavy obligation. ""No strings"" is a guiding Sagittarian motto. Freedom is your most valuable possession. If it comes to a choice you'll take a difficult path, accept less money, dispense with security, do anything as long as you have to answer only to yourself. Your passion for liberty underlies all your other qualities. Prizing it as you do, you also will- ingly grant it to others. You don't meddle in other people's plans or interfere with what they think best for them- selves, and you aren't possessive or jealous. A sense of humor is among your most endearing traits. High-spirited and congenial, you are a gifted con- versationalist, a wonderful storyteller, and a born enter- tainer. Writing, publishing, TV, communications are en- terprises in which there are many Sagittarians. Famous Sagittarians in these fields include Noel Coward, James Thurber, Mark Twain, Garson Kanin, William Buckley, and Woody Allen. You Jupiter-ruled people are unusually versatile. You have wide-ranging interests — music, nature, philosophy, computer technology, theater, animals — and enough en- ergy to do six things at once. What you lack is staying power. Before you finish with one project, you are off to meet the next challenge. One reason is that you become bored doing the same things, and boredom is your worst enemy, but another is simply that you must move on — and up. In business you are imaginative and clever, ready to ac- cept the new and to use it. But you perform best when there's something really important at stake. When you're down to your last chance to win, when it's now or never, you'll put everything you own on the turn of a card and redouble the stakes. You believe in your luck. You are straightforward and honest. Your frankness makes you easy to deal with because one doesn't have to spend time figuring out the hidden significance of unspo- ken clues or nuances. There is no hidden significance. What you say is what you mean. And you're willing to tell all who ask exactly what you think of them, their lifestyle, hairstyle, choices, lovers, you name it. The best part, how- ever, is people can trust what you tell them. Your candid remarks are not meant to hurt; they spring from a desire to tell the truth. Ironically, you are rather thin-skinned and too easily hurt by a thoughtless action or careless re- buff. The keyword in understanding Sagittarius is possibil- ity. To be restricted or feel your choices are diminished is very depressing for you. You tend not to look at life as it is but as you want it to be. In many ways, you rebel against being a grownup. Certainly, you know how to take on responsibility and you've proven yourself strong in the face of setback. Crisis brings out the best in you. It's the ""dailiness"" of life that defeats you. You have grand and wonderful ideas for an adventurous career or carving out a Utopian life or helping the world become a better place. Then you procrastinate, let others deal with the de- tails, lose interest in a plan — and wonder why you're stuck in the same place. However, Sagittarians are among the most likeable people in the zodiac. True, you can be extravagant and wasteful, even on occasion reckless and irresponsible. True, your life is full of forgotten appointments, missed dead- lines, unfinished projects. True, your emotions can be shallow and your commitments almost nonexistent. Over- riding everything, though, is the fact that you're fun to be with. So what if you promise the moon and everyone knows you won't deliver. You know it too. There's nothing underhanded or secretive in the way you deal. You play with all your cards on the table. Impetuous, buoyant, charming, you hitch your wagon to the merry-go-round of life and ride it with insouciant elegance. ","This is the sign of extremes. Scorpio people are variously described as powerful, weak, independent, clinging, passionate, and cold. Clearly, you are a bundle of contradictions encompassing the best and worst in human nature. The key to your personality is intensity. You do nothing by half-measures. Magnetic, emotional, capable of exerting tremendous force, your strength is hidden in the depths. In the sign of Scorpio the element of water is fixed, an image that suggests an iceberg or a bottomless well. You may appear impassive, sometimes unapproachable, but turbulent passions are always roiling underneath, invisible on the surface. You live on many levels. While you present a calm and smiling face to the world, you're ferociously persistent and extremely strong-willed. You're also flexible when it comes to working out solutions. When thwarted, you don't just accept defeat. You're extremely agile when it comes to sidestepping obstacles and figuring out a dozen new ways to get to your goal. In a wonderful paradox, flexibility is one of your most effective methods of controlling situations. Scorpio is the most misunderstood sign in the zodiac because of its complications and convolutions. Basically, you always have a hidden agenda. You're someone of incredible depth and brilliance, and your inner psyche is a labyrinth of wheels within wheels, boxes within boxes. Even when you seem to be at ease and relaxed, you are always evaluating, figuring out your moves, working out strategy. Much of this has to do with control, which is what you are all about. For Scorpio to be out of control is to be in psychic danger. Nothing is worse for you than to feel swept away by outside forces. When you control you are safe. Your Scorpio evolution is the journey toward controlling in positive ways — putting order into chaotic situations, being of use to others and therefore meeting an unfulfilled need, arranging your personal environment so it works smoothly for you. The unevolved Scorpio tries to control other people and manipulate situations for its own greed. Thus, as you see, the forces of light and dark continually oppose each other in your turbulent psyche. What you need is to transmute your fervor into positive relationships and meaningful work. It is very easy to waste yourself on what is unworthy of you, and then your feelings turn inward, become imprisoned, at times even destructive. More than natives of any other sign, Scorpios live at a high pitch of emotion. Its negative aspects are brooding, jealousy, resentment, even vengefulness. The positive aspect is your unswerving dedication once your emotions are engaged. The Scorpion energy, drive, and endurance are legend. Above all, you seek to give your life a meaningful pattern, to find a deeper purpose. You have a philosophical turn of mind and may become interested in religion and the occult. Your sixth sense enables you to intuit things before they happen. You are blessed with a native understanding of the human heart and a great awareness of life's secrets. All the water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) tend to be psychic, but you Scorpios delve into the powers of the mind that others are afraid of. This is the zodiacal sign of birth, sex, death, and regeneration — areas of human existence in which a person confronts the mysteries of the universe. Many Scorpio natives are brilliant doctors, surgeons, scientists, and spiritual leaders. Jonas Salk, Christiaan Barnard, Marie Curie, and Martin Luther are among them. The complexity of your mind makes it difficult for you to skim the surface; you must uncover what lies beneath. Whether you are studying a new subject, learning a language, hunting down a fact, or just reading for amusement, there is a quality of penetration in the way your mind works. Your finest attributes — and your worst — are revealed in relationships. With Scorpio, relationships are usually complicated. This is not surprising when you consider that you can be simultaneously generous and affectionate, violent and unpredictable; in your sunniest moods there is always a hint of an imminent change in the weather. You are deeply loyal to friends but are also intensely jealous and possessive. You cannot tolerate the thought that anyone you love might have a yearning, or even a simple yen, for anyone else. With you, it is usually all or nothing at all. Moderation, restraint, and certainly casual are not in your emotional vocabulary. You never forget a kindness and will try to repay it handsomely. Conversely, you never forgive an injury and will wait years to get even. In fact, most of the time getting even isn't enough — you want vengeance. It is strictly not advisable to do harm to any Scorpion. You make a dangerous enemy, for you are as subtle and deadly as the symbol of your sign. You are a fierce competitor, though often you manage to conceal this from others. You file away pieces of information, facts, and names, and don't hesitate to use what you know if the occasion arises. When you spot a weakness in a rival, you move in quickly for the kill. You are adaptable, able quickly to channel your formidable energies into new paths and to embark on an entirely different career. Confronted with disaster, you will try to turn it into success. Practical and shrewd, you believe in tangible immediate goals, and your singleminded concentration on getting what you want is formidable. Clever with money, conservative about spending it, you have an excellent chance to amass wealth. In business, you tend to accomplish things first and announce them second. By the time an opponent is aware of your progress, it is a fait accompli. Your nature makes you subject to obsessive drives that can be resistant to reason. You will dominate and control anyone who lets you. Suspicious and wary, you are reluctant to trust your heart to anyone. But once you do, you love deeply. Too many astrologers, in describing the sign of Scorpio, forget to emphasize how loving, generous, kind, loyal, even gentle a Scorpio can be. Many idealists who adhere to high principles and are a great positive force for helping others are born under this sign. What all Scorpios have in common is intensity of feeling. Emotion not only rules, it characterizes you. You are passionate in love, and passionate about everything in which you become involved: work, relationships, hobbies, causes. You are an individual painted in vivid colors; there is no such thing as a pastel Scorpio.","You are the person others count on in the clutch, the one who perseveres when less determined spirits fall by the wayside. Because perseverance is the quality most needed for success, you tend to be successful. You are not the pioneer who first strikes out for new territory, but the determined settler who follows and builds houses and towns and cultivates the soil. If you were born under this second sign of the zodiac, there is a pronounced stubborn streak in you. Your greatest strength resides in your tenacity and steady, relentless drive. You are a purposeful achiever who has endless patience to see a thing through, to make it a success. You are the original immovable object and irresistible force. Taurus is a fixed sign, which means its natives are not fond of change. You simply cannot be rushed into anything new. A different approach creates unease and anxiety in you. You are most comfortable and secure with the familiar, and your attitude might be summed up as ""If everything is working fine the way it is, why try something new?"" Everyone knows you have a temper, although you rarely show it. As a subordinate remarked of a Taurean executive, ""No one actually saw him lose his temper, but no one ever doubted that he had one."" Generally, you are equable and patient, as patient as time itself, and it is only when opposed (even then, it will take a lot of pushing) that you become angry. However, there is volcanic activity going on underneath your easygoing, genial exterior. Like a bull quietly grazing in a pasture, you're not looking to challenge anyone, but it would be a fatal mistake for anyone to challenge you. However, unless someone seriously provokes the fierce side to your personality, you are like Ferdinand the Bull, the gentle cartoon character who loves to sit and smell the flowers. You are caring, giving, and affectionate, and have a great fondness for all things beautiful. Ruled by Venus, goddess of love and beauty, you are endowed with genuine creative gifts, responsive to color and design, inspired by art and music. The Taurean taste is supremely elegant. You have a keen eye for what is valuable and are usually an avid collector. Indeed, you were born under one of the two money signs in the zodiac (Cancer is the other one), for Taurus represents material possessions. It's a rare native of this sign who does not think that possessions, objets, wealth, and money are definitely for having — and the more the better. Others are fascinated by your rare blending of a downto-earth person who is such a romantic, poetic sort. In Taurus, the stability of an earth sign combines with the esthetic influence of Venus to create a responsible, steadfast personality with a deep appreciation for the finer aspects of life. Again and again, you'll find that the unique pairing of your artistic vision with your determination to reach a goal is one of the great secrets to your success. You are also driven by the search for security — your byword. You look for permanence in career, love, marriage, and home. Let others gad about, jet-set, gallivant, and sleep around. You are happiest at home, surrounded by the beautiful, expensive things you have collected, secure in the warmth of a mate's devotion, steadfast and faithful to those whom you love. Beneath the surface you are sensuous and sentimental. You don't give lavish gifts as tokens of affection because you are not a carefree spender — value is what you expect for your hard-earned dollar. Although you are willing to follow where your heart leads, you find it difficult to display your feelings openly. Your personality is private and self-contained. Living with you isn't always easy. You can be dogmatic, secretive, stingy, opinionated, and suspicious, and your silent manner may conceal feelings of envy and rivalry. It's hard to get you moving, for you tend to be self-indulgent, even lazy. You have great stores of energy, however, which you put to use when you want to — not when others want you to. Venus emphasizes the social side of Taurus. Although basically shy and reserved with strangers, you can be a wonderful host or hostess. You like to entertain those you are fond of. You may not indulge as freely in frivolous pleasures as, say, Leo or Libra natives, but you are renowned for enjoying good food and good wine in plush surroundings. You believe in pampering yourself with the comforts of the good life. As a person born under this sign, you are an endearing combination of the dependable and sensible, the sensitive and emotional. Inside every practical, stolid-seeming Taurean, there is a romantic dreamer struggling to get out. ","The real drama of Virgo's personality is interior. To the world you may give an impression of calm authority, but you are aware of your own nervous, restless, controlled intensity, the desire to be up and doing, rearranging, improving. You can exhaust yourself more by simply sitting still than others do moving around. The planet Mercury, which rules both Virgo and Gemini, inclines its subjects toward constant activity. However, in Gemini the nervous energy is directed primarily toward stimulation and adventure, while in Virgo the ceaseless drive is to accomplish and perfect. It's impossible for Virgos to put off until tomorrow what might be done today, or to do later what might be done now. You are, in a word, organized. Your idea of taking it easy would seem like hard work to most people. You are not a daydreamer, you're a day-doer. Your emotional life is a constant striving to bring order out of chaos. Although you have a great capacity for love, love alone is not enough for you to be happy. You need more than a mate, home, children, friends. You must justify your life, conduct yourself as a good bookkeeper keeps a ledger — always ready to give a reckoning on whether there's a profit or a loss. You're ambitious, but not just for money. You want to know more, to gain in wisdom, and put this wisdom to practical use. Your astrological symbol of the Virgin tends to be misunderstood. It does not mean you're a prude or lack sensuality. The Virgin stands for purity of purpose. You're not in the game of life to cheat or extract from others. You have higher motives. You want to be of use. In ancient times Virgo was the sign of the harvest — and the symbolic meaning of the Virgin holding a sheaf of wheat is that Virgo people take what has been sown (knowledge, information, skills) and harvest this energy to do something of practical benefit. In the same way wheat is turned into bread to feed our bodies, you want to utilize the gifts you were born with to nourish the world. Intelligence is the hallmark of your sign. You have an excellent memory, an analytical mind, and are known for crystal-clear thinking. You also have a keen ability to probe into human motivations. People like to check their plans with you before putting them into action because you have microscopic vision when it comes to detecting a flaw. Your superb logic cuts through muddled thinking like a laser beam. You instantly zero in on a problem, take apart difficulties, and put them back together in proper order. Because you believe life should be approached rationally, you are without peer in solving knotty problems or tangled disputes. You are convinced that a reasoned presentation of the facts will carry the day. Until you have the facts before you, you are reluctant to make a decision; you want to know why and how a thing will work. Your faith is not in Chinese fortune cookies but in facts, and you distrust vague ideas that don't stand up to critical appraisal or people who make emotional judgments. Yet it would do you a world of good to have a little more faith in general and to trust in synchronicity — that certain events occur or people connect for a fortuitous reason. Your important life lesson is to expand your vision, to look at things in larger terms and believe in the power of faith. Virgo is ruled by Mercury, the planet of thought and mental perceptions, and your ideas form your reality. If you hold on to a negative attitude, then your reality will also unfold negatively. You tend to have difficult getting in touch with your deeper feelings because your mechanism of denial is so firmly set in place. ""I'm not upset,"" you'll say. ""I feel okay about [this other person being promoted instead of me, him dating another woman, etc.]"" Saying you feel ""okay"" covers a lot of messy feelings you'd rather not examine. Also, you often don't see the forest for the trees. A preoccupation with neatness and precision sometimes limits your breadth of vision. That estimable faith in logic also confines your imagination and leaves you a little shy on inspiration, too dependent on established practices and methods. Your nature is to look back and analyze rather than push forward in a new direction. You must know the why and how of everything. Virgo is a mutable sign, however, so you can adjust easily to change once you find a way of fitting the new situation into your routine. You may run into difficulty because of a tendency to complicate everything. No problem is ever simple for Virgo. For every answer you've got a question, and making mountains out of molehills is one of your specialties. Your nature is shy and reserved; it's hard for you to relax, to make small talk or be gregarious with strangers. You prefer one-on-one encounters, in which you can offer the full benefit of your sharp insights and discerning opinions. That's also when people discover how well-read, perceptive, charming, and witty you are. The first thing you learned about money matters is that money does matter. Although you tend to downplay your own ability in financial affairs, no one is better than you at staying within a budget. You aren't tempted into foolish ventures. Your bank balances usually jibe to the decimal point. You want the finest but rarely overpay, and Sun Signs • 35 you have a built-in resistance against self-indulgence. A highly developed sense of discrimination may lead you to be hypercritical. You are unsatisfied with things as they are and continue to analyze situations and people in the hope of finding a way to make them better. At times your finely tuned sensibilities can even make you unhappy, for they give you a heightened awareness of the world's imperfections. However, you resist criticism of your faults from others. It's a rare Virgo who takes criticism well or who can admit to being in the wrong. You are health-conscious and try to make sure you get enough vitamins and go for regular checkups at the dentist. However, in this as in other areas, you can't help being a worrier. As a result you are prone to tension and nervous ailments. Hypochondria is common among Virgos. A warm, loving relationship brings out the best in anyone born under this sign because basically you are kind, devoted, and very loyal. When your affections are engaged you tirelessly try to serve loved ones. They will never have to worry about who's going to keep the checkbook balanced or look after them when they are ill. "
33,Sun Sign Inner You,"The most frequent question you ask is ""Why?"" You want to understand what makes other people tick. Their lives fascinate you because you hope they will offer you insights into your own. You have plenty of love to give, and you want nothing more than to have lots of interesting friends, a wonderful love relationship, fulfilling work, and for the world to be a better place and everyone to be happy. Not much to ask, is it? One of your best-kept secrets is how shy and insecure you are. You wonder if the people you care about feel the same way about you — this is why you work so hard to make others like you. You want to share yourself, but are afraid of losing who you are or becoming what other people think you should be. Yet somehow your feelings of insecurity manage to coexist with a belief that you are someone special. ","You like to be in charge — you want to control your own projects and plans and not be under anyone else's thumb. You have an intense drive to succeed and put a lot of pressure on yourself. Inside, you're filled with nervous energy and worry about how you're going to handle everything. You hate to be bored; you're always looking for something different — new people and places that promise excitement and adventure. You have very little patience; you need to practice sticking things out. You're also impatient with people who can't resolve a problem. You believe in taking action. What you do have are great generosity and enthusiasm. And although you suffer from occasional self-doubt, you know that if you really want to do something, you can! ","On the surface you're the picture of calm and strength, but underneath you tend to feel insecure and inadequate. You are positive that other people know what they're doing while you're just winging it. You also imagine the worst outcome to a scenario, never the best. You are a very emotional person; you are constantly feeling. Hearing a song on the radio makes you feel sentimental, and a particular scent, flower, or picture can jar your memory. You are also extraordinarily in sync with other people's feelings. In fact, you get almost as involved in your friends' problems as you do in your own. When you're close to someone, you believe you are supposed to help that person. Harmony is important to you — any kind of conflict or quarrel leaves you feeling depressed. However, you're definitely not wishy-washy; you have the courage of your convictions and the strength to stick up for what you think is right. You don't welcome change, and are hesitant about going ahead with something untried, yet this doesn't stop you from doing what has to be done. ","You don't need anyone to convince you that life is serious business; you've known it all along. That's what keeps you anxiously asking yourself: Am I fulfilling my responsibilities? Am I achieving as much as I should? Am I self-reliant enough? You know you have the persistence and strength of purpose to reach your goals. But you also have a deep need to connect on an emotional level in your relationships so that you won't feel separated from those you care about. You worry about keeping all that's valuable to you — which includes relationships. Despite your intelligence and the fact that you're so determined, you often feel insecure. You're a bundle of conflicting emotions. You require discipline and order — chaos drives you crazy and makes you doubt yourself and what you're capable of. But maybe the gods meant for you to have some doubt; if you believed you're as powerful as you really are, you'd be impossible to live with! ","You react instantly to new situations, but because you're so keenly attuned to your environment, you tend to have a nervous temperament. And though you give off sparks of energy, excitement, and charm, inside you feel like a wound-up spring. Others are fascinated by your enthusiasm while inwardly you're already bored with this person or that project. In your relationships, you're very giving, but you also need time for yourself. You like to perform, using your wit and intelligence to move to center stage. You love to gossip, mostly because you find out such interesting things! You're generous with your time, friendship, and possessions. One problem is that instead of looking at people's deeper qualities, you tend to judge them by their reaction to you. Are you coming off well; are you mesmerizing them? ",,"You work hard trying to please others and as a result, they find you captivating. However, beneath your friendly exterior, you desperately long for love and approval. You have trouble saying no to others' requests and you take on too many jobs or commitments — and then to prove how nice you are, you keep smiling through the strain while you hide a lot of resentment. It might be more useful to spend time building up your self-esteem rather than looking to others to give it to you. Basically, you give away your power. You hate anything unpleasant and avoid conflict, vulgarity, or strife. If life were a play, you'd always insist on a happy ending. The problem with trying to have constant peace and harmony is that you have trouble making decisions. At times you fear that any move you make will bring something terrible crashing down around you. If you could just lighten up and not be so hard on yourself, you'd be much more satisfied with what you do achieve. You have every ingredient for happiness! ","You absorb impressions, images, and emotions from everything around you, and then filter them through your rose-colored view of how you'd like things to be. This is not to say you cannot deal with reality — it's just that you like to think of life as an ultraromantic movie filled with happy endings and where everyone has the best possible motives. You're a big bundle of feelings. You feel intense joy and happiness when you're involved in a creative project or a loving relationship. The opposite is also true: you can suffer greater depths of sadness than most. Yet you're tougher than most people think. Push you down and you keep bouncingback like a rubber bathtub toy. You're charged with energy and get caught up in what's going on around you. Your greatest strength is in giving to others; you're always ready to help whoever needs you.","Like Scarlett O'Hara, your motto is, ""Tomorrow is an- other day."" Even in your darkest moods, you believe there's a light shining around the corner. Your confidence in the future is genuine, but you hate anything interfering with your plans. You have a hunger to experience life to its fullest — to travel, meet interesting people, and see things you've never seen before. Anything new sparks your inter- est. In fact, you'll usually say yes to a suggestion without weighing its merits simply because it lifts your spirits. And while you're not exactly a moody person, you are high- strung and can become irritable when you start to get bored. You may think no one cares about you or under- stands you when you're feeling this way, but luckily your belief that you're someone special always sees you through. ","You have great strength, determination, and willpower. But no matter how calm and cool you appear on the outside, you've got a well of seething emotions underneath. For the most part, though, you keep your intensity under control by channeling it into useful activities. You're a high achiever, and you seem to ""get"" things in a flash — with powerful psychic feelings you've learned to trust. Your instincts tell you that you're destined to do something important and you're not going to let yourself fail along the way. When you latch on to a new opportunity, you explore it in great depth before going ahead. Deep inside you is a gladiator spirit, and if you channel this fighting energy into positive goals (your continuing lesson), you will always be one of life's great winners. At times, however, you feel you are a lone warrior in a harsh world. You're a complex person who can't always express how you feel, but one thing is certain: The things you want, you want badly. ","You need order in your life — you get anxious when things are out of control. And because the unfamiliar makes you feel insecure, you tend to cut yourself off from fresh experiences. You need to be more open to change. Having beautiful things is important to you, and your instinct for collecting even spills over into relationships. You hold fast to those you care about. You have a few close friends rather than many casual acquaintances. In love, you're happiest when involved in a caring, committed relationship. You're deeply sensitive — a rebuff or harsh word is very upsetting to you — and with strangers, you often feel self-conscious. ","You have plenty of willpower and dedication, and you work harder than anyone to make sure something is perfect. Why? Because if you can't do everything superbly, you begin to fear that you're failing. You are much too critical of yourself. Actually, you're an enigma that no one has quite figured out. You hold back with people you don't know well and are reserved even with those you love. Inwardly, though, you feel very deeply. Intensity and extreme sensitivity are part of your secret self. You like looking after others — giving advice to friends, feeding stray animals, tending sick plants — but you need to be appreciated for the kind things you do. Above all, you want to be useful because you truly care about people. "
34,Sun Sign How Others See You,"You're often regarded as slightly eccentric — not necessarily strange, but certainly an independent character, a kind of daredevil with an unusual way of looking at things. People consider you a pathfinder, a member of the real avant-garde. They think you have a wicked sense of humor, an ability to shock and amuse at the same tine. They know you're open to new ideas, especially when these ideas are yours. People are drawn to your friendliness and enthusiasm, but they withdraw quickly when you turn acid-tongued. Sometimes, because you need so much personal freedom, you give the impression of being uncaring or distant. Those around you may also become annoyed at your stubbornness. ","Your upbeat, magnetic personality pulls people toward you — you bring excitement into their lives. They envy your aggressiveness in meeting a challenge. Whatever the problem, you give the impression that you have an answer ready. You're also admired for your honesty; you don't gloss over difficulties. What people don't like is your tendency toward bossiness and your deserved reputation for being sharp-tongued. They're afraid to cross you in an argument because they know you can cut them to the quick. ","Those in your circle think of you as a den mother — the one who tries to fix other people's problems and make sure everyone is happy. They like your concern for their well-being and cherish your wise counsel. But why, even if they follow your advice, do they keep it a secret from you? Because they think you're controlling and don't want to be a puppet on your string. They also think you're moody. One minute you seem to care about them, and the next you're crabby and to be avoided at all costs. In your career, you're viewed as someone who can quickly spot an opportunity for financial gain. ","You're often seen as an irresistible force and an immovable object. People put you in charge because you're decisive — you're famous for having a great sense of realism. When others need a rational head in a crisis, they call on you. In personal relationships, some friends will stand in line to unload their problems on you; others avoid you because they think your outlook is too downbeat. Everyone agrees that it's difficult to divert you from your course when you've set a goal. Some people feel that in order to find the real you they have to strip away layers of secrecy, but most understand that your aloofness stems from a deep sense of personal privacy. ","People like to be around you because you're interesting and amusing. They admire you for your talent with words and sense of humor. Although you're considered more of a cerebral type, friends trust your judgment about emotional matters. They also know you'll jump in to help when asked. Only those closest to you know you can be moody and discouraged. When crossed you can be sarcastic, which makes some people think you're arrogant. ","You have a regal quality, a way of standing out in a crowd. The unique combination of the excitement you project, your sense of style, your way of speaking, and your laugh is what draws people to you. They're also seduced by the fact that you think big, which feeds their own fantasies of success and power. They're attracted to your energy and enthusiasm and your take-charge attitude. They assume you'll take a leadership position. But some people dislike what they consider your king-sized ego. They think you hog the spotlight and that you're performing even when you're perfectly serious and sincere; they question your sincerity. Others regard you as a showoff who merely talks a big game. And there are those who think you have the temperament of a demanding, spoiled child. ","People feel important when they're with you because you always seem to understand their point of view. You are considered warm and outgoing because you know how to draw people out, and you're thought of as someone with an unparalleled ability to deal with the public. However, because you want others' approval, you tend to go along with what they want — and this sometimes makes you look wimpy. To some people, you also appear vain and overly concerned with your appearance. ","Everyone thinks you are his or her special friend, that they have your undivided attention. You're thought of as solicitous and concerned. You're also known as a sparkling social presence — witty, vivacious, and always interested in new activities. People consider you artistic and somewhat bohemian, and are impressed by your psychic sensibility. They value you as a confidant but, oddly, the more people lean on you, the weaker they think you are. ","People like your sense of humor and your buoyant presence. No matter what goes wrong, you're ready with an upbeat explanation and forecast for the future. You're also the first to volunteer help; colleagues and friends ap- preciate your willingness to do favors. People like your frankness, although sometimes they think you can be too frank and that you put your foot in your mouth too often. To some you seem fickle and undependable, perhaps a bit too detached emotionally. In general, you're viewed as an unpredictable, independent spirit. ","It's probably your secretiveness that makes people so  interested in finding out what you think. You're often the  guru in a group, the one with uncanny hunches about the  future and piercing insights into other people's motivations. Many believe that even your humor contains the  barb of truth. People are aware of your reputation for sensuality and fantasize about you as a lover. You're frequently viewed as over-controlling and too ambitious —  even power-hungry — but also as someone who can be  trusted, because you never make false promises.","You're thought of as a serene influence, someone to  depend on, and you're admired for your organized mind.  Not many people realize that you're sensitive and easily  wounded. You are trusted as a tastemaker, and your artis tic and esthetic opinion is welcomed. Because you have  sound instincts about money, your financial advice is also  sought. On the other hand, people resent your tendency to  be dogmatic. Even if you're right, others don't understand  why you have to be so unyielding. ","You're regarded as a real go-getter. People trust you to handle any job. They think of you as a person who can analyze almost any problem in a logical way. Others come to you when they want their own actions explained to them, or are feeling confused about relationships. You are valued for your ability to set priorities and to create order out of confusion. Because you're both discriminating and truthful, people trust your judgment on books, theater, and clothes. However, you don't wear your heart on your sleeve, and as a result others often perceive you as haughty and cold. "
35,Moon Sign Description,"Aquarius is a most favorable sign for the Moon to be in, for here the Moon's influence confers admirable qualities of sensitivity and perception. Aquarius is the astrological sign of rational thinking and humanitarianism; in this sign the Moon's effect is to bestow clear logic with altruistic concerns. If you have the Moon in Aquarius you are rational, intuitive, and imaginative. Your senses are well balanced and accurate. Your immediate reaction to impressions you receive from the outside world is to deal with them in a scientific, open-minded way and at the same time try to understand them from the human point of view. There are no extremes of temperament in this lunar position. You are neither too emotional nor too cerebral; you are visionary but not eccentric. A Moon-Aquarian has a wonderful gift for expression. You crackle with vitality, are a witty conversationalist, and make a delightful companion. Your friendliness charms all types of people — indeed, you're people-oriented, sociable, and outgoing, interested in other people's problems. However, unlike Moon water signs (Moon-Cancer, Moon-Scorpio, Moon-Pisces), you never become so emotionally involved that it changes your own life. There is a balance that runs through your relationships. The passions of Aquarius-Moon people are passions of the mind. You are interested in ideas, philosophy, higher learning. You enjoy science and mathematics, as well as art, music, literature. Again, I repeat, you are not a person of extremes. You are well-rounded intellectually, for you have a wide range of interests in many different fields and associate with a large number of varied people. Aquarius is the sign of future knowledge, and as a Moon-native you are interested in the unknown and what lies ahead. Many lunar Aquarians seem to be clairvoyant, to see things before they happen. On the other hand, you are not especially practical or down to earth. It can be said that you have a wide outlook but short sight. You tend to see things in terms of large concepts, but when it comes to the hard work and sweaty toil of turning a concept into a reality, you are likely to drift off in search of a new idea. Moon-Aquarians are often known as giants in promise and pygmies in performance. The unusual — in people, in places, and in projects — is what interests you most. In love, lunar Aquarians have a butterfly quality — alighting for a while to sample an experience, flitting off to find something new. You are inclined to be somewhat ambivalent about love affairs. While you have a strong roman216 • Less Well-Known Influences tic streak, you also have a horror of being suffocated by another person's demands. You cannot bear possessive, jealous lovers, and you're often drawn to emotionally unavailable types. Unconsciously, you choose people who shun you; the less interested someone is in you, the more interested you become. In your early years you spend a lot of time trying to figure out what you want as opposed to what you think you want, swinging back and forth between romantic longing and feeling totally detached. You seek a fine balance between commitment and independence, and many Aquarius-Moon people go through a number of unsatisfactory amours. When you do marry (often in later years), the relationship quickly becomes as much friend-and-companion as husband-and-wife. To you, the most important glue in a relationship is communication. In general, male lunarAquarians have a somewhat easier time emotionally than female Moon-Aquarians, apparently because it is still more socially acceptable for males to be intellectual and emotionally detached. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the AquariusMoon qualities of intelligence and individualism run through your personality. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), an Aquarius Moon emphasizes your superior mental gifts and ability to deal successfully with different kinds of personalities; this is a successful combination for people in the field of communication. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), an Aquarius Moon lends imagination and the common touch to your dynamic, exuberant forcefulness; this is a wonderful combination for people in public life. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), an Aquarius Moon adds to your practicality a gift for innovation and original work; this placement is excellent for performing artists. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), an Aquarius Moon accentuates your imaginative, clairvoyant qualities; you have a unique talent for self-expression. Whatever your Sun sign, an Aquarius Moon gives you an independent, stimulating mind, a persuasive charm with people, and a side to your personality that is always titillated by the unconventional. ","Aries is an active, fiery sign, but the Moon is cool and passive. This disparity gives great brilliance and sharpness to the senses, but also results in a nervous temperament. If you have the Moon in Aries, you have a high-strung disposition. Your sense-impressions of the world around you are swift and instantaneous, and you never doubt them for a moment. As a result, you tend to be very sure of your opinions and don't like it when people question or contradict you. Patience is not your long suit. You won't spend time laboriously wading through details; you prefer to plunge right in and see what happens. In the vibrant sign of Aries, the Moon endows you with charm, vivacity, and a special knack for getting others to do what you want. You are extremely fond of talking (about almost anything) and sound knowledgeable on a wide range of subjects. But you have a short attention span. Although enthusiasm and energy abound, the long, hard necessity of really performing often causes you to fall short of your goal. But you are quick to pick yourself up and move on to something new and exciting, leaving the old project to wither away. However, if you are pursuing a goal you really have your heart set on, you will drive yourself to the limit of your endurance. Where you really excel is on the social scene. You are able both to stimulate and to delight, and no party should be without the wit and sparkle of an Aries Moon. In addition, you are generous when you feel kindly disposed toward someone. You give unselfishly of your time, attention, concern, and even your money. However, a Moon-Arien who feels slighted or unappreciated will sulk and pout and complain about the world's harsh treatment. On the plus side, you have a great passion for life. A basic optimism underlies your personality, and unless your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), you don't hold a grudge for long. Your most striking characteristic is a hatred of restriction. You will do what you want without any interference, thank you. Because you resent advice, you rarely are willing to listen to other people's opinions. This obviously has its drawbacks. But in a situation in which a decision must be made instantly, no one is more decisive and forceful than you. You perform best under pressure and handle emergencies as quickly as a firefighter answering an alarm bell. In emotional relationships you struggle against being tied down or dominated. You have to be the one in control. You demand freedom in a relationship, but this is exactly what you won't give in return. You insist on being the center of your lover's attention. You want to be loved passionately, and you want love to be always exciting and romantic. If an affair dwindles into ordinariness, you quickly grow dissatisfied and restless. The sign of Aries symbolically represents a fork in the road, and the lives of Moon-inAries people are marked by sudden change. They often reach positions of authority and are successful in the world of business and government. As a Moon-Arien the essence of your emotional life is the love of the chase. You view life as a grand quest, and impulsively pursue love, success and attention from others. The chase, in fact, is far more satisfying than the prize itself. Achieving the prize is never as thrilling as wanting the prize and galvanizing your energy into going after it. No matter what your Sun sign may be, an Aries Moon confers a quality of self-confidence and an adventurous spirit that runs through your personality. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), an Aries Moon underlines your impulsiveness and enhances your magnetic ability to sway others; you have great dash and energy. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), an Aries Moon bestows a shrewd intellect and persuasive powers of expression. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), an Aries Moon accentuates your leadership ability and lends your personality a certain positiveness and advanced outlook. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), an Aries Moon emphasizes imagination and intensity; you have an increased ability to create striking original work. Whatever your Sun sign, an Aries Moon confers quickness of mind, an outspoken nature, and an inability to live under other people's strictures. ","The Moon is in its natural home in Cancer, for this is the sign that the Moon rules. Here the best qualities of the Moon — devotion, patience, sensitivity — are brought out. The romantic, intuitive sign of Cancer and the sensuous, receptive Moon are in harmony with each other. If you have the Moon in Cancer you have strong emotions and perceive the world around you through your feelings rather than your intellect. However, because you do not openly show your feelings, it is sometimes difficult for others to figure out where they stand with you. In general, you are more receptive than active. You store away impressions, reactions, and information until the time comes when you can use them. Lunar Cancerians often excel in an artistic or literary way. Jean-Paul Sartre, Lord Byron, and Ethel Barrymore are famous and typical Moon-Cancerians. Imaginative and creative, you work best when you set your own pace and are not subject to the tyranny of time clocks. Any impression that sinks into your mind makes an indelible mark. You have an extremely retentive memory. Lunar Cancerians are often found in professions where memory plays an important role: historians, teachers, actors, writers. Famous Moon-Cancerians in these walks of life are Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Benjamin Spock, Humphrey Bogart, and Harrison Ford. At heart, you are refined, delicate, and gentle. You may appear to be aggressive and forceful, especially if your Sun or Mars is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), but underneath you are vulnerable and easily hurt. You tend to let your feelings fester, and indeed, touchiness, moodiness, and a kind of quiet self-pity always lie near the surface. Though you are subject to greater mood swings than other Moon signs, your ups and downs don't last long. If you are left alone for a while, the dark clouds will soon blow away. One of the most striking characteristics of Cancer is the continual ebb and flow of emotions, which combined with the waxing and waning influence of the Moon produces quick shifts in temperament and at times makes you emotionally exhausted. You are at your best in a deep and committed love relationship. Unfortunately, you often have to go through an unhappy love affair before you find the contentment and security you seek. Even though you are motivated strongly by your feelings, in a curious way you are also afraid of them. It is your nature to mistrust love, to feel you are somehow unworthy of someone else's devotion. You will hold on too long to a relationship that's destructive because deep in your psyche you don't believe you'll ever find another love. You also believe that to be alone is a fate worse than death. Very often early in life a Moon-inCancer person must go through an emotional trial. But when at last you find love that feeds your soul and you feel secure, your personality blossoms. You have a tendency to hold on possessively to a loved one, and a knack for subtly instilling guilt in someone you love, usually to test the person's depth of feeling. However, among your most endearing traits are intense loyalty and dedication. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the CancerMoon qualities of creativity and emotionalism will be evident in your personality. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), your intensity and depth of feeling are accentuated by a Cancer Moon; you have superb intuition and almost hypnotic power in creative work. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), you have unshakable loyalty and strong passions under the influence of a Cancer Moon; this combination gives you an ability to capture the imagination of the public. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), a Cancer Moon gives your intellectualism a magnetic, daring quality; you have the ability to touch other people's feelings. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), a Cancer Moon directs your enthusiasm and energy into creative channels; you have a flair for drama and the theater. Whatever your Sun sign, a Moon in Cancer gives you sensitivity and imagination, enormous personal charisma, and a warmhearted, romantic nature. ","Capricorn has both a stabilizing and restrictive effect on the shifting influence of the Moon. The Moon represents the emotional, sympathetic side of a personality whereas Capricorn is an unemotional and undemonstrative sign. People with the Moon in this position have to overcome obstacles and complexities within their own natures to find the happiness they constantly seek. If you have the Moon in Capricorn you have an alert mind and are very eager to learn. However, you are not interested in vague theory; you want to put your knowledge to use. An example of this talent for practical application is Thomas Edison, a Moon-Capricorn whose Sun was in Aquarius. In Edison we see the inventive, far-reaching vision of the Aquarian truth-seeker, but the focus of his work was to make his experiments useful, to put them into everyday utilization. His inventions of the telegraph, phonograph, electric light, and moving picture changed the way we live. Another example of a Capricorn-Moon is Gene Kelly, whose Sun was on the Leo-Virgo cusp. In his life we saw the creativity and exuberance of Leo, the hard work ethic of Virgo; his Capricorn Moon was evident in how he took his knowledge of dancing and applied it in a practical way to film choreography. In the process he introduced an entirely new genre of musical comedy and changed the very way such movies were filmed. If you have a Moon in Capricorn you are organized, ambitious, and usually a prodigious worker. Self-sufficient and a bit solitary, you are haunted by a feeling of responsibility, of a task you must fulfill. You are a determined person but your singlemindedness can sometimes turn into obsession. You pin your hopes on one idea, turn all your energies in one direction; if you fail you may suffer serious depression. Of course, because of their unshakable commitment, most lunar Capricorns succeed and often make an imprint on the world. Napoleon Bonaparte, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln all had their Moon in Capricorn. Lunar Capricorns who have their Sun or Ascendant in one of the cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, or Capricorn) have particularly auspicious auguries for leadership. Money is important to you, not so much for what it can buy as for the status it bestows in the world of business, politics, finance, and high society where you wish to shine. You have charming social manners and an instinct for getting to know the right people. Unknown to all but your closest intimates, you suffer 214 • Less Well-Known Influences from feelings of insecurity and loneliness. Often you conceal this with a dry sense of humor. Your secret terror is of being abandoned or having someone you love cease to love you. You find it hard to reveal your deepest feelings and therefore may be perceived as being cold or calculating. For many lunar Capricorns, authority and power are a compensation for the difficulties they encounter in emotional areas. Lunar Capricorns tend not to find true love in youth. Cautious and reserved, you tend to turn your feelings inward, and you need a lot of emotional reassurance before you allow them to be drawn out. You also have difficulty putting your complete trust in someone else. But at some point, usually when you are past thirty, you find the person you can become totally involved with, and then your love is durable. When you feel secure within an emotional relationship your commitment may last your entire lifetime. You are loyal and steadfast, generous and giving. In fact, you often give more than you get back. This is especially true about the relationships of female lunar Capricorns to their lovers and friends. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the Capricorn Moon qualities of steadfastness and dedication manifest themselves in your personality. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), a Capricorn Moon underlines your executive talent and ability to achieve great rewards; you have hidden depths to your character. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), a Capricorn Moon lends force and dynamism to your creativity; this is an excellent position for attracting wealth and fame. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), a Capricorn Moon brings strength and intensity to your resourcefulness and encourages far-ranging interests; this is a good combination for people in communications, television, and publishing. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), a Capricorn Moon confers a special gift for authority and self-reliance; you have a mesmerizing personality. Whatever your Sun sign, a Capricorn Moon gives you persistence, an ambitious and powerful personality, and an instinct for excellence. ","In the lively, restless sign of Gemini the Moon's sway becomes more mutable and erratic. This does not make all Moon-in-Gemini children flighty, frivolous, and frenetic, but almost always indicates an active mind, an imaginative and creative personality, and someone who is inclined toward intellectual pursuits. If you have a Moon in this position you are extraordinarily quick to receive sensory impressions from the outside world. You rapidly sift through information and make your judgments. Because Gemini is a mental sign, your snap decisions tend to be more intellectual than emotional. It is not that you are unfeeling, simply that your immediate reaction to stimuli is on a mental plane. You are a fast learner, probably have a high IQ, and are an excellent critic, for you have an ability both to analyze and to verbalize. A Moon in the communicative sign of Gemini inclines you toward loquaciousness and endows you with great personal charm. You have enchanting vivacity that draws others to you. Conversations with you tend to run off on unexpected tangents and take sudden turns and reverses. At heart, a lunar Gemini is essentially restless and needs constant stimulation. If forced to be indoors or solitary or inactive, you are unhappy and should try to set aside a part of the day to get out and be among people. A Moon in Gemini makes you extremely impressionable to the changing scene around you. Skill in speaking and writing predisposes many lunar Geminis to become writers, teachers, and journalists. John Keats, Rudyard Kipling, Jack London, and George Bernard Shaw are only a few famous Moon-Geminis of the past. As a Moon-in-Gemini person you are always mentally assessing what you are feeling. You tend to dissect your feelings and emotions to analyze why you think this way or behave that way. The most famous lunar Gemini who possessed this quality is Sigmund Freud. Freud also had his Sun in Taurus and Scorpio Rising, giving him extraordinary tenacity and depth of insight. You are quick-witted and vibrant, and when you come across a new fact or a different way of looking at something, you are likely to undergo a change of mind. One can't count on your firm convictions, but your openness to life makes you a fascinating companion. In emotional relationships lunar Geminis display a certain free spirit. Here is where you are most intensely restless. You resent being subject to the whims and vagaries of other people's emotions, and struggle to retain independence. At the same time, you search for the ""perfect"" love, which of course does not exist. If your would-be lover is elusive or hard to figure out, this especially piques your interest. The Moon-in-Gemini personality is high-strung. You have a streak of discontent that sometimes shows up as irritability and snappishness. On the other hand, you are amusing, witty, and have a wonderful sense of humor. When you are in the right mood you are a delight to be with. At times your talent can be stymied by the fact that you lose interest in things so quickly and drop what you so eagerly began. You thrive on travel, change, and meeting different kinds of personalities. In business, your best qualities are versatility and a winning way with people. You perform very well when linked in partnership with someone practical and hardheaded. Having to make a final decision is torture for you; you need a strong, decisive partner. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the GeminiMoon qualities of versatility and intellectualism can be discerned in your personality. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), your keen intelligence is accentuated by a Gemini Moon and you have a superb gift of self-expression. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), your emotional nature is sharpened by the Gemini-Moon mental acumen; you have strong creative instincts and a talent for research. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), a Gemini Moon gives you quickness of mind that you can use in a practical way in combination with your Sun sign persistency. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), a Gemini Moon bestows high mentality that combined with your passion and adventurism indicates superior leadership ability. Whatever your Sun sign, a Moon in Gemini imparts a witty intellect, an independent spirit, and an imaginative sparkle to your personality. "," In the magnetic, flamboyant sign of Leo the Moon's power is positive and robust, and even its dark side is less dark than in other signs. Leo is a wonderful placement for the Moon because it gives great warmth and stability to the Moon's influence; it also imparts an idealistic quality. If you have the Moon in Leo you have strong emotions and can be reached through your heart rather than your head. You are a quick and accurate learner when your feelings are involved. But if a subject does not arouse your affections, you have no interest in exploring it further. The sensory impressions you receive from the world around you come to you on an emotional level. In order to make you change your mind, someone first has to change how you feel. One of your most striking characteristics is a refusal to be hampered by other people's rules. You tend to be extremely intelligent and are hospitable to new ideas, but you have little sympathy for petty or narrow thinking. You like to be the center of attention and enjoy taking on public roles. You are highly expressive, and are especially drawn to the world of theater, music, painting, and the arts. In a way, it might be said that you, like all lunar Leos, have a ""show biz"" personality. You possess a wonderful sense of humor and great personal charm, which makes you fun to be with. There is a sense of excitement about you. If nothing is happening that is interesting or amusing, you'll try to create it. Sincere, open, very sociable, you have a way of lifting the spirits of people around you. Moon-in-Leo people work very well in group enterprises because they have a talent for inspiring people to do their best. Your immediate reaction to a problem is to confront it rather than sit around moping about it. A natural leader, you often feel you have a mission in life. Sometimes you may become bossy and overbearing — you are an order-giver rather than an order-taker — but at heart you are so cheerful and enthusiastic that people find it easy to forgive you. You have a fund of optimism and energy that others draw upon. Vanity is a chief weakness; you are a sucker for anyone who can deliver an artful compliment. You always need an audience and are inordinately fond of attention. It must also be said that you will probably get more than your share of attention because the Moon in Leo imparts a lovable quality to your personality. You are drawn to the luxuries of life — good food, fine wines, striking clothes. You are an excellent host or hostess who delights in giving glittering parties. Unless Taurus or Capricorn is prominent in the horoscope, a Moon-Leo will always pick up the check. Fortunately, you usually are able to pay for your extravagant tastes. In love, you are a great romantic, yet your flamboyant romanticism would never be sparked by someone who won't make you look good. You need a partner who sets you off to best advantage and keeps up your image to the world. Your tendency is to put the object of your affection on a pedestal, to credit a lover with superlative virtues that may have no basis in reality. When a lover does not live up to your expectations you are disappointed — not only because you take love seriously but because your lover always becomes an extension of yourself, and his or her failure to be wonderful is very wounding to your pride and ego. Also, though you are jealous and possessive toward your loved ones, you yourself are flirtatious and a bit of a rover because you need everyone to admire you. You are an attention addict. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the Leo-Moon qualities of warmth, vitality, and charisma will appear in your personality. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), a Leo Moon accentuates your creativity and leadership abilities. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), a Leo Moon lends a dynamic, compelling quality to your people-oriented personality. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), a Leo Moon gives you an even stronger passionate nature and good moneymaking skills. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), a Leo Moon heightens your already powerful emotional impact on others. Whatever your Sun sign, a Moon in Leo gives you dignity, an affectionate, outgoing nature, and an instinct for leadership. ","Libra is the sign of esthetic perceptions, and here the Moon's romantic, glamorous influence is accentuated. If you have the Moon in Libra you have a keen appreciation for beauty and art, and an artistic eye unmatched by any other Moon sign. You also have a heightened awareness of your environment and of other people. However, what you truly value are those experiences that make life more beautiful and pleasing. You abhor coarseness, vulgarity, or strife. Your immediate reaction to anything unpleasant is to deny it, or, if that is impossible, at least to put it in its best possible light. You try to surround yourself with comfort and lovely objets in a tranquil and luxurious environment. If it were possible, you would live forever in a flower-filled room with soft music playing in the background. Because you enjoy beautiful things, you are happy to spend your (and sometimes other people's) money on possessions that catch your fancy. You are the kind who will walk into a shop and instantly spot the perfect thing to go with what you have in a closet at home. The presentation and ritual surrounding a thing is as important to you as the thing itself. A meal served on fine china and crystal with embroidered linens, flowers, and candles on the table is as important as the taste of the food itself. The Moon in the balanced sign of Libra endows you with an open, independent mind that tries to evaluate the world dispassionately and rationally. A Moon in Libra also confers great personal charm and enhances the ability to get along with people. You are marvelous at understanding the other person's point of view (though you never lose sight of your own self-interest). For the most part you are pleasing and easy to live with and have a genial disposition. Libra is the astrological sign of partnership, and as a Moon native you function well in that relationship. Very often your destiny is tied up with a strong and influential person with whom you form a connection early in life. To a large extent, what you accomplish depends on other people. Essentially you love with your head rather than your heart. There is something a bit calculated about your carefully balanced emotional nature. To become your lover, a person has to possess certain qualities, such as good looks and elegant social manners. It is not that you are unemotional, but love is more an esthetic pleasure than steamy passion. You try to create something beautiful — fanciful if need be — from every intimacy. You may go through a number of affairs and marriages before you finally settle down with someone with whom you are mentally compatible (more necessary to you than sexual compatibility). When you are in a contented marriage, it is a source of great satisfaction to you because it answers your need for security and reassurance, and you truly enjoy sharing. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the LibraMoon qualities of refinement and grace can be traced in your character. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), Libra Moon accentuates your keen mentality and gives you an unsurpassed ability to win favor with other people. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), Libra Moon endows your strength of purpose with a creative bent; this is a winning combination for entrepreneurs and those dealing with the public. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), Libra Moon underlines the intuitive, imaginative side of your personality and gives a strong, balanced intellectual approach. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), Libra Moon heightens your magnetism and flair, and aids your ability to put original ideas into successful action. Whatever your Sun sign, a Moon in Libra gives you a polished, charming manner with people, an instinct for fairness, and artistic vision. ","Pisces and the Moon have a natural affinity; Pisces is the sign of depths of emotion, and the Moon represents your instinctive emotional reactions and sometimes your hidden dreams. Pisces is also the astrological sign of sorrow and self-undoing. If you have the Moon in Pisces you have deep feelings and an innate understanding of the human condition. A peculiar danger for anyone with this Moon position is that the impressions received from the outside world will not accurately reflect the world as it is. Instead, they are filtered through an intense romanticism. Your instant reaction to stimuli is to interpret things as you would like them to be rather than as they are. You wear the realitydistorting glasses of the incurable optimist, the dreamer, the poet. Your romantic emotionalism is not always apparent on the surface, for you try to keep this part of your nature well hidden. However, even the most pragmatic person with a Moon in Pisces feels the need to escape into a world of private imagination. As a Moon-in-Pisces person you are artistic and have a keen love for beauty and the arts. Many Moon-Pisceans have a flair for acting, writing, composing, or painting. Gifted with vision and imagination, you express yourself well in creative areas. It is through the senses and emotions rather than the intellect that you perceive things. You are extraordinarily intuitive and sometimes are gifted with psychic vision; you seem able to strip away the veil that separates the real world from the spiritual world, and to know things that others cannot comprehend. In the real world, unfortunately, you do not always have an easy time. You tend to let your emotions get the better of you. Though you seem confident and completely in charge (especially if your Sun is in a fire sign [Aries, Leo, Sagittarius] ), you have a weakness for letting those with strong wills and definite opinions lead you onto unsuitable paths. Although you can work tirelessly and unselfishly for others, you find it hard to be strict and disciplined with yourself. Having to make final decisions causes you conflict and anxiety. There is a strong tendency to escape harsh realities and obligations. Sometimes you are perceived as gullible, but it is only your emotional nature that makes you appear that way. You are easy prey for unprincipled types who play on your tender feelings. It is an axiom in astrology that Moon-Pisceans are born under a special 218 • Less Well-Known Influences vibration that impels them to befriend humanity. Indeed, it is through helping others that you liberate yourself. In love, as in the rest of your life, you prefer the illusion to the reality. It is the wild passion, the feeling of being swept away, that you desire. Your most favorite lifemoments are when you feel the euphoria of love enveloping your entire being. You are a romance addict, and many Moon-Pisceans who drift from affair to affair keep wanting to experience the fabled glow of love as a form of psychological escapism. You are a romantic who will do everything you can to make a mate happy. It is your nature to do this, even if you do not get an equivalent return from the other person. At the same time, you feel vulnerable and dependent and build up an elaborate array of defenses to avoid being hurt. However, once you get past playing the role of the victim, you are able to sustain a truly joyful relationship of honesty and depth. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the PiscesMoon qualities of creative imagination and sensitivity affect your personality. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), a Pisces Moon accentuates your intuitive nature and spirituality, and confers unique artistic talent. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), you combine strength of purpose with the Piscean-Moon perceptiveness and idealism — an excellent placement for those in politics and humanitarian work. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), a Pisces Moon combines with your keen powers of communication to endow you with clairvoyant ability and a gift for touching the emotions of others. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), a Pisces Moon gives your dynamic energy more depth and profundity; people with this placement have a hypnotic effect on the public. Whatever your Sun sign, a Pisces Moon gives you a sympathetic heart, an artistic temperament, and a great capacity for doing work that will make a lasting impression.","In Sagittarius, the Moon takes on a sparkle and brightness that it does not have in other signs. Sagittarius is the astrological sign of higher learning and breadth of vision. Here the Moon's influence loses its passivity. If you have the Moon in Sagittarius you are noted for your quick, sharp mind, extraordinary insights, and an ability to get things done in a flash. Your clear-thinking intelligence sifts through sensory impressions swiftly and with startling lucidity. You are the kind of person who envisions great goals and then, undaunted by possible failure, sets about achieving them. You rarely listen to advice about pitfalls and drawbacks, nor do you wait to find out if a plan is impractical or unworkable. With energy and enthusiasm you rush in and usually accomplish what you set out to do. One reason for your success is your keen judgment. With a Moon in this sign of lofty vision, you have a way of seeing farther than people with the Moon in other signs. As a Moon-Sagittarian you are fond of open spaces, travel, new people, different surroundings. Among your most winning traits is adaptability — to different kinds of personalities and to foreign and strange places. Your immediate reaction to a new experience is to explore and learn more. To you a chance to expand your horizons is always welcome, and you are not exclusively interested in making a profit. Money, in fact, does not stay long in your pocket or checking account. You feel that the whole purpose of money is to buy pleasure. You want to enjoy life. At times you can be quite careless and reckless. Since you believe in your luck, you tend to abandon yourself to whatever fate has in store. You operate on the theory of optimistic fatalism. The danger is that you may push your luck too far. However, a setback does not keep you down for long. With renewed high spirits and a fresh outlook, you hitch up your wagon once more to the stars. Because of your charm and geniality, you have a knack for making friends. You also have a witty way with words and a buoyant sense of humor. Your social gaiety sweeps others along on a tidal wave of goodwill. One of your most endearing qualities is your ability to perceive the best in people. When you criticize, you do so with such openness and candor that it is comparatively easy to take. Unlike the other fire Moons (Moon-Aries and MoonLeo), Moon-Sagittarians are not highly sexed and passionate. You look on love more as an adventure. You enjoy the thrill of discovery, the stimulating high of being in love, but you are unwilling to immerse yourself in deep emotional intensity. After a while your lovers may complain of your detachment or unreachableness. A perfect soulmate for you is someone who looks more outward than inward, and in time your love affairs become more like friendships. You are also noted for a roving eye and a refusal to be tied down to one person or one place. You need a lot of personal space and independence. This does not necessarily make you a bad marriage partner — you are a marvelous companion — it is just that you do have a certain lightheartedness about love and fidelity. Life to you means change and variety, and this attitude has a way of also applying to love. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the SagittariusMoon qualities of optimism and expansion express themselves in your personality. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), a Sagittarius Moon accentuates your self-confidence, adventurous nature, and appetite for experience. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), a Sagittarius Moon lends you vitality, enthusiasm, a keen intellect, and a talent for salesmanship. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), you combine commonsense practicality with a lofty, creative outlook; this is an excellent position for people in politics and law. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), your emotional, imaginative personality is galvanized by the energy and philosophical vision of a Sagittarius Moon; this is a successful combination for writers and artists. Whatever your Sun sign, a Sagittarius Moon gives you a love for learning, humanitarian instincts, and a gift for being an independent thinker. ","Scorpio is the astrological sign of death and regeneration, also of extremes of emotion. The effect of Scorpio is to underline the Moon's sensuous power and at the same time bring out its forcefulness. If you have the Moon in Scorpio you have a spiritual nature and intense feelings that motivate your actions. You are very clever at hiding your true feelings. A Moon in Scorpio is one of the more difficult lunar positions. Though you are driven by strong passions you tend to deny that they are your motivation. You often disapprove of your emotions (for example, your anger or jealousy), and therefore keep your reactions hidden under a calm, agreeable surface. You can exercise great self-control. If an experience becomes painful, you cut yourself off from your feelings (in effect, kill your pain) rather than continue to suffer. You particularly dread any form of rejection. Your ability to deaden feelings allows you to feel in control, but it is also the path to slow destruction of the spirit. In Scorpio, the lesson of finding your Moon's true potential for wisdom and self-mastery is often difficult. Basically, you must learn to let go emotionally and feel your pain, and through the experience expand your phenomenal ability to love. A Moon-in-Scorpio person possesses enormous willpower and acute powers of observation. Your judgments are shrewd and accurate. You are blessed (and/or cursed) with a phenomenal memory. This is usually a great aid to you in your work, but it causes you to brood over an emotional wound or injury. Some Scorpio-Moon types will never forget and will wait years to get revenge. This does not necessarily mean that you are cruel and vengeful, but at any time in life you can instantly recall a slight to your pride — remember exactly what the other person said and how bitter you felt at the time. Your persistence and determination enable you to rise above obstacles, and this Moon position unfortunately has more obstacles than others. There is usually a secret sorrow or trouble in the lives of Moon-Scorpios that very often concerns family problems or health. This lunar position creates a need for escape into fantasy, although higher Scorpio-Moon types use the spiritualism that is so much a part of this sign to do work that benefits humanity. Though passion is always a factor with you, your sexuality can be sublimated in other areas, such as creative work or a career that demands self-sacrifice. Work is important to you, for it is through work and effort that you are best able to express yourself. You have high standards, and pride of craftsmanship is visible in all your endeavors. You tend to be ambitious and are endowed with executive ability. This is especially true if your Sun or Ascendant is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn). Without even being aware of it you possess a sensuality that attracts the opposite sex. This is often a source of difficulty in your love life, and many lunar Scorpios marry more than once. A fear of being controlled is at the core of your relationship issues. For you to be in a position of emotional vulnerability puts you in a classic Scorpio deathlike situation, for to be unsafe means you are at the mercy of another person. It is almost impossible for you to put complete trust in someone else, and it takes a long time for you to commit yourself fully. The secret is your great need for emotional security and, in a sense, there is no security that is secure enough. However, once you feel unthreatened, you are capable of deep love. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the ScorpioMoon qualities of persistence and intensity run through your personality. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), a Scorpio Moon confers energy and creativity, a true gift for turning a dream into reality once you set your mind to it. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), a Scorpio Moon accentuates your managerial talents and capacity for authority and leadership. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), a Scorpio Moon bestows deep mental powers and an ability to captivate the public. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), a Scorpio Moon emphasizes your compelling personality, your vitality and drive for success. Whatever your Sun sign, a Moon in Scorpio gives you a strong inner core of self-reliance, an arresting sensuality, and a magnetic flair for influencing others. ","The Moon is at its best in Taurus (in astrological terminology, the Moon is exalted in this sign). The stable sign of Taurus steadies and strengthens the Moon's otherwise changeable, erratic influence. The Moon in this position gives you great powers of concentration. You live your life the way you tackle a job: systematically and getting it done right. Whereas others complicate their lives, when you're confronted with a problem you look for the most effective way to deal with it, and even if it's personally painful for you, you get it handled. The sign of Taurus also brings out the quiet, reflective qualities of the Moon: you carefully ponder the senseimpressions you receive from the world around you before you reach a conclusion. With a Moon in Taurus you do not form opinions quickly and are quite the opposite of impressionable. It takes a while for you to come to a decision — you must be sure of all the facts — but when you do there is no way to make you change your mind. One can't change a Moon-Arien's mind either, but the difference here is that Aries Moon quickly reaches its decision. With a Taurus Moon you take your time assimilating information. Once you have done that, you will purposefully, relentlessly, and unchangeably follow your course. Taurus is the astrological sign of earthly possessions, and a Moon in Taurus indicates a person who is resourceful, someone who gathers material things. As a Moon-inTaurus person, you are also blessed in that you seem to have the least emotional problems of any Moon sign. This may be because Taurus is practical and positive in its outlook, as well as methodical, patient, and responsible. Small wonder that history is dotted with the achievements of lunar Taureans. A few among many are William Shakespeare, Karl Marx, and John Milton. The sign of Taurus is ruled by Venus, planet of romance and the arts, and a Moon in this beauty-loving sign endows you with a keen artistic sense. You are romantic, have elegant manners, and usually display a distinctive style of dressing. The Moon is a sensual influence and in Taurus indicates a great love of creature comforts. You enjoy serene surroundings, the pleasures of a luxurious home, the joys of good dining. Although socially adept, you dislike big parties and large, noisy groups. Your idea of a wonderful evening is a small, candlelit dinner party at home with four close friends. In love, lunar Taureans are the one-man/one-woman type, and are happiest in a close, committed union. Sometimes it may seem otherwise (especially if the Sun is in a flirtatious or highly sexed sign), but at heart Taurus-Moon wants the comfort of a committed relationship. Your security is heightened by sharing your home and pleasures with the person you love and who, in turn, is devoted to you. You look for a true soulmate, and when you find him or her you happily and faithfully settle down. The other side of the coin is that a Moon-Taurean has a tendency to stay too long in an unhappy love affair or marriage. Because of your need for security and resistance to change, you shut yourself off from new experiences and settle for what you have. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the TaurusMoon qualities of patience and determination run through your character. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), your remarkable endurance is underlined by the stability and persistence of a Taurus Moon; this is an excellent combination to achieve success and material wealth. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), a Taurus Moon heightens your personal magnetism and gives strength and perseverance to your creative imagination. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), a Taurus Moon gives you firm resolve and inclines your intellectual powers toward practical, moneymaking pursuits. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), a Taurus Moon adds to your physical strength and your fiery exuberance, and gives your personality great force and the ability to win popularity with the public. Whatever your Sun sign, a Taurus Moon gives you endurance, a conservative outlook, and a sensitive, sensual personality that needs love and security. ","The sign of Virgo stabilizes the shifting effect of the Moon. Virgo is the sign of intelligence and practicality, which gives a sharp analytical bent to the Moon's influence. If you have the Moon in Virgo you have a fine, discriminating mind. You do not pursue knowledge merely for the sake of learning; you figure out how to use what you learn. Your immediate reaction to the sense-impressions you receive from the world around you is to analyze what you have just seen and heard. You are meticulous in sifting through information and you tend to question whatever is told to you. Moon-Virgos are sometimes so skeptical they don't even believe in what they see with their own eyes. You love to discuss ideas and probe into opinions held by others, though you yourself hold fast to preconceived notions. You are not so stubborn, though, that you will hold on to a theory once the facts prove you wrong. You are a seeker of truth, and you believe truth is what is left after falsehoods have been exposed. No one would call you a Pollyanna or the kind who looks at the world through rose-colored glasses. It's not that you are dour or pessimistic, it's just that you deal with life as it is. This practical realism makes you good at business and at handling money. Your eye is on the long-term profit rather than immediate gain, and you are concerned with security and providing for your old age. As a Moon-in-Virgo person you bring an extra touch of perfectionism and professionalism to everything you do. Methodical in your approach to problems, you figure out exactly what needs to be done and then tackle the issue a step at a time. But you have a tendency to worry, to fret over the things that might go wrong and try to cover all contingencies. You think that too much good work is ruined by the lack of just a little more effort, so you don't spare yourself and are often fussy and critical with others. Logic is the discipline you live by, and you find it frustrating to deal with minds that are illogical or scatterbrained. You think such people belong in Disneyland, not in the real world. Discriminating in the people you choose for friends, you are also selective about the cultural activities you take part in. There is a certain judgmental quality that you bring to almost any situation. No experience washes over you aimlessly; you always learn a lesson from it. Moon-in-Virgo women are sometimes thought of as unfeminine because they are usually so efficient, thorough, and well organized — qualities that most people don't associate with the word ""feminine."" Both male and female of this Moon sign are reserved and shrink from sentimentality or gushiness, and therefore are often perceived as cold. In truth, the less developed types who pick other people apart and exhibit a stingy pettiness are cold. Generally, however, Virgo-Moon people are caring and giving in practical ways; one can count on them. Virgo is the sign of service, and lunar Virgos want to be useful to others. In matters of love Virgo-Moon people don't have a lot of self-confidence. One might think that the ideal mate for you would be someone intelligent, logical, nice looking, and neat, but how many can marry a clone? Actually, you are attracted to people who are quite unlike you — more emotional and effusive, less calculating, more readily able to express their feelings. In love relationships, Virgo-Moon people take on the role of a critical but caring parent. Unconsciously, lunar Virgos are afraid of anger and feeling vulnerable, and tend to live in the illusion that their love lives are calm, stable, and under control. No matter what your Sun sign may be, the Virgo -Moon qualities of caution and seriousness show up in your personality. If your Sun is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), practicality and industriousness are even more pronounced; you are also very money-conscious. If your Sun is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), Virgo Moon brings strength and endurance to support your expansive creativity; this is an excellent combination for politicians and people in the theater. If your Sun is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), Virgo Moon contributes an even sharper intelligence and a flair for original work. If your Sun is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), Virgo Moon lends greater dimension to your emotional nature, for you are blessed with a rare combination of psychic truth and hardheaded realism. Whatever your Sun sign, a Moon in Virgo gives you keen mental powers, a strong vein of common sense, and an intelligent, thoughtful approach to life. "

38,Rising Sign Description," If you have Aquarius ascending, you usually make friends easily. You are quick-witted and lively, open in your dealings, honest and truthful. You are an inventive conversationalist who paints word pictures that amuse and fascinate. Intelligent and charming, you are particularly suited to a position of leadership. You are idealistic in your outlook and want nothing more than for all the world to be happy and harmonious. Even the idea of conflict upsets you. You want to see the best in humanity and are hopeful about the future. Though you have a reputation for fairness and tolerance, there is a strong streak of inflexibility to your nature. Much of this is the impatience you feel toward those who do not have your visionary or lofty ideas. Rising-Aquarians are modern, forward-thinking, and progressive, yet you are as set in your ways as Capricorn or Taurus. One could say that you hold firmly far-out opinions. The choice for most people is to accept society as they find it or try to improve it. You want to construct a new society that will correspond to your vision of the ideal. You are often intolerant of other people's shortcomings and can be wickedly sarcastic and very funny at the same time. Your razor-sharp powers of observation help you to uncover flaws that you can poke fun at. You are a system of paradoxes. You enjoy being with people but are perfectly content to be alone. You like to travel but love relaxing at home. You are friendly and outgoing but, at other times, moody and reserved. You have both a scientific and an artistic turn of mind. In your career, you often are involved in two distinct areas of work. Fame comes rather easily to Aquarius-Rising people, and many times it is just as easily taken away from them. Your life tends to be marked by unexpected triumphs and reversals. When good fortune smiles there is often a dark underside to it. For example, many RisingAquarians inherit money, but it often turns out that the legal entanglements are more trouble than the inheritance is worth. Aquarius Ascendants approach new places and situations with a spirit of adventure, even though the spirit does tend to wear thin. You become quickly bored. RisingAquarians usually marry early in life and find contentment with their mates. Though most of you are comfortably off by the time you reach middle age, you never quite make all the money you'd like. Friends are helpful to you in both career and personal matters. As a person with Aquarius rising, you tend to have a wide forehead, fine bone structure in your face, and dreamy, wandering eyes. Many of you are quite tall and rangy-looking. The planet Uranus, which rules Aquarius, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of Uranus bestows independence, originality, friendliness, a reforming spirit, versatility, and a hatred of restriction. It also encourages rebellion, unpredictability, tactlessness, eccentricity, and contrariness."," Aries is A very strong ascendant. If you were born with Aries rising, you are adventurous and pioneering. You like to take on the role of a leader, even if the leadership is in a small area. For example, in your friendships you are the one who tries to dictate where you will meet, what restaurant or movie you will go to. An AriesRising child will be the most domineering and ego-centered among his or her brothers and sisters. As an Aries-Ascendant person you have strong likes and dislikes and are never shy about expressing them. Your dealings are straightforward and honest. You are uncomfortable with lies, fraud, and elaborate deceptions. You will always try to get right to the point, say whatever is on your mind, and see what happens. There is a contagious enthusiasm about you. You are an activist and doer rather than a thinker. Warm, generous, lively, you have a very friendly people-oriented quality. You like to be noticed. Sometimes Rising-Aries people have a reputation as troublemakers. This is not because you are malicious (quite the opposite is true). But you like to throw off old, conservative ways of doing things and try a new, brasher, more direct approach. You plunge right into whatever the problem is and give it your best. As far as you're concerned, obstacles are just there to be butted down. However, if the obstacle won't move you won't butt your head off. You will quickly lose interest and bound off to find a new challenge, further excitement. You may be a groundbreaker, but if you should get stuck in the middle of a furrow, you'll drop the plow and move on to new ground. Aries is the sign of beginnings. What you're really best at is the beginning of a job. You have the exuberance, verve, and energy. Once you master an idea, you won't stick around until all the how-to-do-its are in place. Aries-Ascendant people are accident-prone. Because you are impulsive and quick to rush in headlong, you usually don't look where you are going. You tend to trip and fall, bump into things, cut yourself. Often your face and head are more prone to injury than other parts of your body. As a person with Aries rising, you are likely to have a flashing smile, piercing eyes that move quickly from object to object, gold or reddish coloring in the skin or hair, a muscular body, and an agile quick movement to your step. The planet Mars, which rules Aries, is very prominent in your chart. The influence of Mars bestows great willpower, stamina, an aggressive sex drive, and a need for achievement and recognition. It also brings on strain, tension, conflict, selfishness, a quick temper, and accidents with fire and sharp instruments."," If you have Cancer rising, you are very sensitive to emotional signals from other people. You have extraordinary insight into human motivation. There is a reserve about you that is sometimes difficult to penetrate, but underneath is a warm, affectionate, loving, and giving nature. You are adaptable to different kinds of people even though you are not liable to make instant friendships. It takes a while for you to let someone get really close. CancerRising people tend to moodiness, and others may not always find you in a receptive frame of mind. Sometimes you can be crabby and impatient and exhibit a snappish temper. You are touchy, and others have to be careful of what they say lest they hurt your feelings. Your sensitivities are so heightened that you sometimes take offense where none was intended. However, this same sensitivity is what sets you apart from the crowd. You possess great imagination and awareness. Many Cancer Ascendants are extraordinarily gifted as writers, poets, and painters. Because you are so tuned in to the nuances of other people's motivations, you are able to absorb what others are feeling and thinking. You pick up opinions, thoughts, facts from all around you and, being very clever and practical (as well as visionary), you are able to put all this information to work for you. Cancer Ascendants are also clever with money, prudent and cautious, and have a native shrewdness in business. You know how to make wise investments and where to get the best value. Though you usually have to climb the ladder through your own efforts (rather than the efforts of others), you are likely to accumulate material success as the years go by. You won't hog the spotlight, but on the other hand you want public recognition for your talents. With Cancer rising, acclaim and applause can be hard to come by, so you tend to have a way of feeling sorry for yourself. You complain that the world does not appreciate you, but your complaint is usually an effort to win reassurance that quite the opposite is true. As a Cancer Ascendant you have obstacles in your path, especially when young. However, as you surmount each difficulty and succeed (Cancer Rising has great tenacity of purpose), you become stronger and more self-assured. If you have Cancer rising, you are likely to have a round expressive face, pale luminous eyes, slender arms and legs, and a rolling gait to your walk. Your body may be thickset through the middle, and you are prone toward putting on weight as you get older. The Moon, which rules Cancer, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of the Moon bestows kindness, imagination, sympathy, deep emotion, an ability to cherish and protect, a retentive memory. It also encourages laziness, inconstancy, restlessness, passivity, and untidiness."," If you have Capricorn ascending, you tend to have a serious turn of mind. One would not call you melancholy, but you certainly aren't frivolous. Cautious in your dealings, you are reluctant to commit yourself until you know the score. With strangers you are often quiet, reserved, perhaps a bit shy. But once you open up you can be lively, friendly, warm, and expressive. Capricorn Ascendants have strong personalities, possess great willpower and determination, and diligently pursue their goals. These goals are usually for a better life — money, status, a higher standing in the community for your family. It's important to you to feel that your life is meaningful. You have self-esteem and are reliable, dependable, and stable. Sometimes, though, you will strive toward a goal and when you achieve it will still not be happy. You have a sense that something is missing, and you continue your search. You have an active mind with quick intelligence and an ability to concentrate. You can ferret out information, see flaws in a plan, map things out ahead in detail. Sometimes you may be accused of being too calculating, because you add up all the pros and cons before embarking on a project. If an opponent has a weakness, you are also quick to spot it — and not entirely above using it to your advantage. You tend to fuss over details to make sure all contingencies have been covered. It's your way of being in control — you don't want bad luck to catch you unprepared. RisingCapricorns are worriers; in youth you worry about life, in old age about death. In middle age you worry about success. It isn't always easy for Rising-Capricorns to show their feelings, though powerful feelings do exist. You love deeply, are loyal and protective, and go out of your way to do kind deeds for others. However, you are often torn by jealousy and resentment (which you hide), and down deep you never really forgive someone who does you an injury. What you achieve is mainly through your own efforts rather than through the influence of others. Though it happens that Rising-Capricorns seem to benefit financially through marriage, your own hard work within the union is largely responsible for your gain. With Capricorn Ascendants there is often a rivalry with brothers and sisters, or some kind of disagreement with their fathers. As a person with Capricorn rising, you tend to have a small, well-shaped head, deep and penetrating eyes, and a beautiful smile with good-looking teeth. You have strong feet and usually enjoy walking or jogging. The planet Saturn, which rules Capricorn, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of Saturn bestows discipline, ambition, patience, determination, good endurance, and thrift. It also encourages stubbornness, hardship, melancholy, aloofness, pessimism, and selfishness."," The first impression others receive of you is of someone in constant motion: your hands gesticulate, your eyes dart here and there, your body does not sit still in a chair. Restlessness underlies your personality; it is the symptom of your yearning for something that is just beyond your reach. You need change and variety and are often discontent with your present lot. Gemini is the sign of duality and this is evident in the lives of Gemini Ascendants. You can be happy and unhappy at the same time, satisfied yet dissatisfied. Of course, this can be said of many people, but in your case you are discontent for a specific reason: You feel you have not lived up to your potential. You sense that there is an experience just over the horizon that will make you feel truly fulfilled, and you resent the strictures that you may think keep you from venturing out to find it. A striking characteristic of Gemini-Rising people is their ability to use words to say exactly what is meant. To you, clarity is a tribute that words pay to ideas. You are well informed, witty, mentally quick. Gemini-Rising people tend to move into positions of prominence not by force of will but by their facile way of handling people. You adore having an audience. Many of you become actors and writers and are successful in the entertainment industry, TV, journalism, and the literary world. As a Gemini-Rising person you have an excitable nature that is quick to react to any stimulus, to come up with an answer to any question — and also to get upset easily. You throw yourself into a project with verve and enthusiasm, then worry and fret (usually quite audibly) about this thing going wrong or that person not liking you, about how long everything is taking. However, you have a marvelous mercurial quality, and your high spirits and interest are quickly revived. You go out of your way to keep busy, if not at your vocation then at your avocation. You love puzzles, games, books, and the computer — anything that will amuse and occupy the mind. There is a basic coolness to the GeminiRising personality. Even though you love to be with people and appear to have charming warmth, yours is a mental rather than emotional outlook. You deal with feelings and relationships exactly as you do with facts and figures — as things that can be analyzed. There is also a tendency to be egotistical, for fundamentally you know that you know better than others. You like to encounter many different situations and people. You travel, change residences and occupations, and often marry more than once. Blessed with a natural sense of drama, you know how to heighten and brighten any experience. As a Gemini Ascendant, you tend to have small sharp features, twinkling eyes that are filled with humor, a friendly smile, and graceful arms and hands that you use to great effect. You move with quickness and agility and hold on to your youthful looks well into old age. The planet Mercury, which rules Gemini, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of Mercury bestows a high intellect, acute perceptions, cleverness, adroitness in speaking and writing, and a flair for foreign languages. It also encourages arrogance, sarcasm, snobbishness, cynicism, and disorganization."," Leo ascending signifies nobility of character, high ideals, and great personal magnetism. If you have Leo rising, you are big-hearted, expansive, benevolent, and kind. You consider it beneath you to stoop to pettiness, carping, stinginess, or narrow-mindedness. Because you are so magnanimous in spirit, you find it hard to believe ill of others. You are the opposite of the Irish as Dr. Samuel Johnson described them: ""A fair people; they never speak well of each other."" Of course the world does not always live up to anyone's expectations, and Leo Ascendants are puzzled and hurt by meanness and ungenerosity At such times you simply put on your regal air and make sure the underling knows in what contempt and low esteem he or she is held. Rising-Leos have a great sense of showmanship. You love to put on lavish displays — whether it is decorating your house with expensive and elegant things or dressing in attention-getting clothes or throwing a splendid dinner party. To less flamboyant types you may appear ostentatious, show-offy, and extravagant. But your showy displays are not only to get attention; you see life in larger-than-life terms and aspire to the highest and the best. This quality draws others to you and, in itself, attracts power and influence. Leo-Rising people seem surrounded by luck in money, career, and friendship. You are not an especially hard worker but tend to achieve success through the influence and pull of others. Fame and fortune come to you when you aren't looking for it. You are efficient at organizing groups of people and inspiring them to give their best. You are happiest in the role of leader. In fact, you feel wounded if your public doesn't put you in that position. When not given what you feel is your due, you can turn haughty, temperamental, and arrogant. Leo is the sign of pride, and Ascendant natives have this in abundance. You are self-confident and have a resolute faith in yourself. There is a basic likeableness about you, partly because you give the distinct impression that life is fun. You have a wonderful sense of humor. (Note: Rising-Leos have a particularly soft spot for children and spoil them outrageously.) As a Leo-Rising person, you tend to have a large, beautifully shaped head, thick shining hair, a dazzling smile with bright, even teeth, and a stately bearing. Many of you are benefited by an inheritance later in your lives. Whatever path you choose to follow, you usually emerge on the sunny side of the hill. The Sun, which rules Leo, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of the Sun bestows enthusiasm, generosity, power, warmth, creative self-expression, passion, and courage. It also encourages egotism, arrogance, snobbism, conceit, pomposity, and condescension."," Libra is a most pleasing and harmonious Ascendant. If you have Libra rising, you have natural charm, grace, and poise. You are extremely social-minded and take pleasure in being with other people in a convivial atmosphere. Parties, holidays, laughter, fun, and good times are what Libra Ascendants revel in. You have a gay and genial personality and are full of hope for the future. No matter what disappointments today may bring, RisingLibrans fantasize happy tomorrows and look forward to living them. Of course, you are not this way all the time. One of your problems is that you are easily thrown into despair and depression, especially by downhearted and discouraging people. Libra is the sign of balance, but it doesn't take much to push Libra Ascendants off balance. Basically, however, your spirits are optimistic and blithe. You are born with a great sense of fairness, and nothing angers you more than to see injustice go uncorrected. You are deeply upset by cruelty, violence, bloodshed, strife. To you life should be serene and content, but it must, above all, be fair. Libra Ascendants are refined, neat, and discriminating. You breathe rarefied air. Your aloof quality is sometimes hard for others to figure out, but it will never leave you even though you function so well with other people. You gravitate toward artistic and creative endeavors, but sometimes your artistic flair lies dormant and unused, for you dislike hard work and prefer to take the easy way out. You don't have to seek the spotlight, however; it shines on you. You don't struggle to find success; luck often comes to Libra Ascendants through a partner, mate, or close association. You like travel, new people, new projects. You happily throw yourself into enterprises that promise excitement or diversion. The trouble is you don't have much perseverance, so a great many things go unfinished. Another difficulty you have is making up your mind. You weigh a decision carefully, vacillating between one course of action and another; when you've finally decided you still hesitate. There is a timidity behind all this pondering, a fear of taking risks. You are unhappy when single and fond of being married. (This does not necessarily mean that you will stay married to the same person.) Somewhere along the way Libra Ascendants are likely to gain wealth and material possessions through a marriage partner. As a rule you don't have a lot of children, but you take great delight in those you do have. As a Libra-Rising person, you tend to have a strikingly good-looking face, graceful and symmetrical bone structure, and a radiant smile. Your body is usually curving or round, though not necessarily fat. The planet Venus, which rules Libra, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of Venus bestows beauty, charm, social graces, a romantic nature, an appreciation for art, music, and decoration. It also encourages superficiality, jealousy, laziness, dependence on others, and a weak will."," If you were born with Pisces rising, you carry within yourself a strong artistic gift that must sooner or later find expression. You have an active fantasy life and a pronounced romantic outlook. You want life to be perfect and since it isn't, you choose not to see what you don't want to see. Down deep, many Rising-Pisceans believe that they alone are destined to suffer disillusionment in life; sometimes others sense this secret sorrow in you. Often you feel you were born at the wrong time in the wrong place, and you are strongly drawn to the past. Basically, you have a dauntless goodwill toward others. You tend to be very sociable, fond of entertaining, and enjoy the warmth of companionship. You love the good life — fine food and drink especially, beautiful clothes, and travel. At parties Rising-Pisceans are vivacious and verbal (sometimes you talk too much); you enjoy performing in front of a group. A talent for mimicry makes many Pisces Ascendants turn to the theater. The word sentimental comes to mind when describing you. Your tender feelings are easily moved by sad stories, lost animals, unhappy human beings. Your personality is also changeable, at times moody and distressed. Worry and imagined fears overtake and sometimes overcome you. In your private life you tend to be disorganized, a bit careless, the kind who is forever losing or misplacing belongings. In work, however, you are knowledgeable and creative and can be quite disciplined when working within a group, especially in artistic projects. You are also successful in occupations that involve writing and travel. Many Rising-Pisceans frequently change their residence. It often happens with Pisces Ascendants that a person who was an adversary in early years becomes a valuable friend later on. You may sometimes have trouble with a first marriage because of in-laws and relatives. As a RisingPiscean you are probably fond of children; your own children usually bring you pride and happiness. If you have Pisces rising, you tend to have large, luminous eyes and a sensuous mouth. You are likely to have wavy hair and well-shaped feet. The planet Neptune, which rules Pisces, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of Neptune bestows compassion, sensitivity, keen intuition, imagination, creativity, and an interest in spiritual things and the occult. It also encourages confusion, indecisiveness, worry, vagueness, carelessness, and self-deception."," A Sagittarius Ascendant favors independence and freedom. You cannot bear to be stifled by outmoded ideas or difficult lovers or tedious work. You are progressive, full of optimism about the future. You are also restless in spirit, anxious to get on with the business of living, ready to accept a new challenge. Sometimes your impatience is misunderstood. Your sensitivity toward other people and your need for freedom are part of the same personality. You grant freedom to others and never try to limit or restrict another human being. Sagittarius Ascendants are basically humanitarians, idealists who care deeply about injustice. On a personal level, you are honest and generous to others and easily wounded when confronted with selfishness or thoughtless cruelty. It's true that you can expect too much of your fellow man. You have a knack for making friends, for you are very open to new people and new ideas. You enjoy a spirited discussion, an exchange of opinion. (Rising-Sagittarians have a reputation for frankness: other people always know where they stand with you.) You are interested in research, blessed with imagination, foresight, and clear thinking. You like to travel, see new places, learn how the rest of the world lives. Usually you tend to read a great deal, watch the news, subscribe to periodicals, plug into the latest information on the computer, talk about current events with friends. You prefer the simple life, with not too many trappings or obligations. You like money, but your real appreciation is for the independence it affords. You fear that if you take success too seriously, life will become boring. One of your problems is that you don't measure the consequences of what you do. You are impulsive, sometimes reckless. To take action is the main thing, to do something about a problem. You don't always stop to consider where all the activity may lead. Marriage is not the most important thing in your life. Sagittarian Ascendants have a tendency to marry the wrong person (at least once) and get into unhappy romantic situations from which they must extricate themselves. Travel is a major theme in your life, and luck surrounds you in foreign countries. Many Rising-Sagittarians live out their later years in another country. As a person with Sagittarius rising, you tend to have a pleasant, cheerful face, a broad forehead, bright, humorous eyes, and a friendly smile. You often make sweeping gestures with your arms and hands, and have a strong, active body. The planet Jupiter, which rules Sagittarius, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of Jupiter bestows good fortune, happiness, generosity, breadth of vision, sincerity, and a genial social manner. It also encourages restlessness, self-indulgence, conceit, impatience, wastefulness, and gambling."," If you were born with Scorpio ascending, you put the whole force of your personality behind everything you do. You are not a halfway person. Rising-Scorpios have an intensity, a dynamism that seethes and roils under the surface. Your willpower and determination are formidable. Though you are sometimes viewed as a lone wolf, you do have an ability to work with people — actually, to lead people. You are strongly persuasive and zealously pursue your goals, and in addition have the power to make others pursue the same goals. Clever, creative, and resourceful, your fertile mind seems to be an inexhaustible source of ideas and suggestions. Your brain behind your cool facade is always ticking away. One of the things you must do is find out how something works, to dissect it, study it, and put it back together so that it works better. This is also true in artistic terms; you can do great visionary work if you have Scorpio rising in your chart. As a Scorpio Ascendant you are happiest when you can control from behind the scenes. You tend to be secretive and reserved, and shun the spotlight because you can't work there unnoticed. If you are domineering, it is a subtle dominance, a kind of mind control. Some people claim that they are hypnotized by Scorpio Ascendants; it's true that you have a way of knowing what others are thinking. Much of this comes from your acute powers of observation. You are a charming, witty conversationalist, but the acute observer will soon notice that it is the other person who is doing most of the talking. You are usually quietly watching, waiting, observing — filing away information that will be useful later on. Rising-Scorpios have a reputation for a sharp temper; the reputation is deserved. When crossed, you can be cruel and biting. You tend to use any weapon at your disposal — from ridicule to playing on a person's fears. In the heat of that moment, Rising-Scorpio must be the victor. Later, you are remorseful for having dealt wounds, though it is extremely hard for you to say so. Scorpio is the astrological sign of hidden passion; Scorpio Ascendants tend to have a secret love affair at least one time in their lives, and usually marry more than once. Astrologers have observed a strange pattern in which RisingScorpios often lose their first spouse to death. They seem to suffer more financial setbacks and disappointments than other rising signs; but no other sign is more victorious in the end. As a Scorpio Ascendant you tend to have sharp features, a prominent nose, and large, hypnotic eyes. Sometimes your brows are thick and dark. Your body is agile and moves decisively. The planet Pluto, which rules Scorpio, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of Pluto bestows powerful feelings and emotions, a sense of purpose, persistence, determination, plus the imagination and ability to make a successful start in a new direction. This planet's influence also favors secrecy, suspicion, jealousy, and cruelty"," There is a steadfastness, a basic calm about a Taurus Ascendant. If you have Taurus rising you tend to be placid and easygoing. You also have charming social manners and a strong artistic bent, for the sign of Taurus is ruled by Venus, planet of love and esthetics. You want to create beauty and harmony in your life, and many Taurus Ascendants have a flair for writing, decorating, or composing music. Taurus-Rising people don't push their opinions on others. On the other hand, once you make up your mind (after due deliberation), you rarely change it. You hold on to your opinions and can be very stubborn and obstinate. You are also quite set in your ways, though this is not always apparent at first. It's the little clues that give you away: you may eat the same breakfast day in and day out; if you are fond of a particular color (possibly in the blue or rose family, which are Taurean colors), you may use it repeatedly in your clothes and throughout your house. Doing things the same way you've always done them gives you a sense of stability, and this is a fundamental need. Taurus-Rising people have a reputation for laziness that is not entirely deserved. It is true that you love creature comforts, elegance, luxury, physical ease, and lots of leisure. However, you can and do work very hard, especially if motivated by the promise of money or by the approval of someone you love. Determined, persistent, and strong-willed, you possess endless patience to see a thing through, to make it a success. Taurus is the sign of wealth and material possessions, both of which are extremely important to you. You have a tendency to brood about your future security: Will there be enough to keep from starving? Are you going to be able to pay the rent next year? The fears and worries do not require a basis in reality. In fact, though you may have to struggle for money when you are young, Taurus-Rising people tend to accumulate wealth as the years roll by. Owning things can sometimes become a mania; you covet possessions and once you own something you guard it jealously and are heartbroken should you lose it. You never resign yourself to the fact that things break, tear, wear out, get lost, and are stolen. In relationships, as well, you tend to be jealous and possessive, although you are adept at hiding this. One of your weak points is your vanity, and you rarely forgive anyone who ridicules you. Having to cope with rivalry is hard for you. You may try to pretend the prize is not worthy of your talents. As a person with Taurus rising, you tend to have an unusually good-looking face, large round eyes, and clear skin. Often your neck is short and thick, and your body gives the impression of weight and sturdiness. Becoming overweight is a problem, especially in later years. The planet Venus, which rules Taurus, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of Venus bestows grace; charm; a love of pleasure, art, and adornment; and social awareness. It also encourages overindulgence, superficiality, jealousy, and conceit."," Virgo ascending indicates an analytical outlook. Though the degree of emotionalism depends on other influences in your horoscope, it is generally through the mind that you perceive the world. This is not to say you are cold and insensitive. Indeed, the opposite is true, for Virgo Ascendants have deep and tender emotions and care a great deal about others. However, it is the process of thinking logically that gives you the deepest satisfaction. You appreciate the finely tuned mechanics of sifting through facts and information, finding the truth of the matter, introducing order and reason into almost any situation. Rising Virgos are rather fixed in opinion, but not so inflexible that they will not change their minds upon careful review of opposing facts. To you, the cardinal sin is to be ignorant of one's ignorance. A fault sometimes is your inability to put things in perspective, a proclivity for getting bogged down in minutiae and losing sight of the big picture. You magnify the importance of a petty detail and then become resentful if others fail to see its significance. Work is important to you, and you usually accomplish a great deal during your lifetime. Often you are at war within yourself, both wanting things to come easily and needing to achieve solely through your own efforts. Control — both of self and of events — is what makes you feel secure. As it turns out, most Rising-Virgos do gain through their own hard work rather than through the influence of others. You have a charm and elegance that is difficult to pin down. You are not always easy to know intimately. Your shyness and aloofness (sometimes well disguised by a social veneer) must be penetrated by anyone who wishes to become truly close. Emotionally, it's hard for you to show your feelings, though a great deal is always going on under the surface. As children, Rising-Virgos sometimes suffer from poor health. Happily, health improves the older you get. For many of you, a marriage partner brings property or wealth. Later in life Rising-Virgos frequently become property owners, often in a foreign country. Success for you is often linked to dealings in and travel to places far from home. As a Rising Virgo person, you tend to have a gentle, oval face, eyes that sweep around a room and take in everything, and a body that gives the impression of frailty but is actually very strong. The planet Mercury, which rules Virgo, is very prominent in your horoscope. The influence of Mercury bestows a logical mind, acute powers of observation, an intellectual outlook, perception, and a flair for science and writing. It also encourages fussiness, a nervous temperament, sarcasm, fault-finding, and worry."
