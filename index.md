### There aren't any highways that lead to Taos, but there are traffic patterns. 

The Texan, when you tell him that your plans aren't demarcated in an itinerary and may last upwards of 6 weeks, will respond:
> "My granddaughters are doing things like that, taking gap years and that sort of thing. *Things have changed.*" 

This response can also be phrased: > There are a lot of people out here finding themselves; some of them get stuck out here too and end up staying". 
The same answer, with a nostalgic tone is phrased:
> "Getting a good trip in before you get married and settle down?"

In my capacity as a hitchiker, I politely nod. I don't explain that in my own interpretation I am not doing anything particularly radical, engaging in any sort of abandonment of convention or attempting to find a lost 'self'. I do, internally, wax Foucaultian on "normal" and "deviant", on how quickly their mental picture has found room for me. To understand the Texan is to understand that where I am from, 'normal' has overtones of boredom; an inherited language of self description and creation. The Texan hears in it overtones of sanity and righteousness. Where I am from, wealth unchains the adventurous, creative and experimental; to the Texan it unchains the pursuit of agreed upon goals.  

"The American Dream" is overlayed for the Texan with the immense and real opportunities that oil country has provided for decades. Ranchers in west Texas often lease the minerals under their ranches, which they bought for pennies an acre, to Exxon and the like, and in return recieve checks for upwards of $1M/month, and phenomenon which one west Texan described to me as 'mailbox money'. He added, 'That's not good for human beings, mailbox money'. Entrepreneurs can make deals with private equity companies wherein they provide no capital, receive a 1% state in a project, succeed in an extraction, and leave with $10 M + in returns. The next time around they can submit table stakes, and with a track record of success get a 15% stake. Lower level employees in such companies often receive equity stakes in such operations which allow them to make $1 M or more. The oil & gas career track is well worn, and lucrative down the ladder. 

Neither evolution nor climate change can be observed -- only inferred from the observation of time-sequenced data. Science in the service of engineering stands on sturdier footing - the bridge, the wheel, the piston all evidence the truth of the theorums which give rise to their construction. Verifying a better theory civil engineering has no temporal variable, it's preferability will be known when the alternative bridge can carry heavier traffic. The best theory of climate change will only be known when its predictions come true. A scientific mind, however, should not struggle to accept such an explanation. A great scandal of our time is that the most vociferous climate deniers are our most successfull engineering organizations.

It is difficult to make a man understand something that his career depends on him not understanding, but the first step in misunderstanding is an education of acquisition rather than one of questioning. The antithesis of philosophy is no longer poetry, it is engineering. 

I am reliably more effective at hitching rides without the use of my thumb. I used to advertise my request to everyone on the ski bus; now I find someone without kids and ask directly -- providing an easy out, to be polite. The trip is 30 minutes all in, from changing in the parking lot to the door of my hostel, which is on the only road from the mountain.

Annie accepts, warning me that she lives in a van, and will need a few minutes to change and rearrange some things. She has outfitted her F-350, formerly an ambulance, with a bunkbed, a woodburning stove and two burners. "A real work of father-daughter bonding", she said, confessing a . Having locked her three pairs of skis in a compartment on the side of the truck and subsequently broken the lock, she has been riding on a pair of loaner skis that she picked up from an industry friend. A CPA, she left her job, but her boss, unable to find professional CPA's in the area, offered that she could work 30 hours a week from the van. She accepted. Holding four season passes, 

It's not that
